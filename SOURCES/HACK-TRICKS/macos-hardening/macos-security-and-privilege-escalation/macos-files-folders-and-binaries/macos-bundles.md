## Basic Information

Bundles in macOS serve as containers for a variety of resources including applications, libraries, and other necessary files, making them appear as single objects in Finder, such as the familiar `*.app` files. The most commonly encountered bundle is the `.app` bundle, though other types like `.framework`, `.systemextension`, and `.kext` are also prevalent.

### Essential Components of a Bundle

Within a bundle, particularly within the `<application>.app/Contents/` directory, a variety of important resources are housed:

- **_CodeSignature**: This directory stores code-signing details vital for verifying the integrity of the application. You can inspect the code-signing information using commands like:
  %%%bash
  openssl dgst -binary -sha1 /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/Assets.car | openssl base64
  %%%
- **MacOS**: Contains the executable binary of the application that runs upon user interaction.
- **Resources**: A repository for the application's user interface components including images, documents, and interface descriptions (nib/xib files).
- **Info.plist**: Acts as the application's main configuration file, crucial for the system to recognize and interact with the application appropriately.

#### Important Keys in Info.plist

The `Info.plist` file is a cornerstone for application configuration, containing keys such as:

- **CFBundleExecutable**: Specifies the name of the main executable file located in the `Contents/MacOS` directory.
- **CFBundleIdentifier**: Provides a global identifier for the application, used extensively by macOS for application management.
- **LSMinimumSystemVersion**: Indicates the minimum version of macOS required for the application to run.

### Exploring Bundles

To explore the contents of a bundle, such as `Safari.app`, the following command can be used:
%%%bash
ls -lR /Applications/Safari.app/Contents
%%%

This exploration reveals directories like `_CodeSignature`, `MacOS`, `Resources`, and files like `Info.plist`, each serving a unique purpose from securing the application to defining its user interface and operational parameters.

#### Additional Bundle Directories

Beyond the common directories, bundles may also include:

- **Frameworks**: Contains bundled frameworks used by the application.
- **PlugIns**: A directory for plug-ins and extensions that enhance the application's capabilities.
- **XPCServices**: Holds XPC services used by the application for out-of-process communication.

This structure ensures that all necessary components are encapsulated within the bundle, facilitating a modular and secure application environment.

For more detailed information on `Info.plist` keys and their meanings, the Apple developer documentation provides extensive resources: [Apple Info.plist Key Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Introduction/Introduction.html).
