## Firewalls

* [**Little Snitch**](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html): It will monitor every connection made by each process. Depending on the mode (silent allow connections, silent deny connection and alert) it will **show you an alert** every time a new connection is stablished. It also has a very nice GUI to see all this information.
* [**LuLu**](https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html): Objective-See firewall. This is a basic firewall that will alert you for suspicious connections (it has a GUI but it isn't as fancy as the one of Little Snitch).

## Persistence detection

* [**KnockKnock**](https://objective-see.org/products/knockknock.html): Objective-See application that will search in several locations where **malware could be persisting** (it's a one-shot tool, not a monitoring service).
* [**BlockBlock**](https://objective-see.org/products/blockblock.html): Like KnockKnock by monitoring processes that generate persistence.

## Keyloggers detection

* [**ReiKey**](https://objective-see.org/products/reikey.html): Objective-See application to find **keyloggers** that install keyboard "event taps"&#x20;

## Ransomware detection

* [**RansomWhere**](https://objective-see.org/products/ransomwhere.html): Objective-See application to detect **file encryption** actions.

## Mic & Webcam detection
