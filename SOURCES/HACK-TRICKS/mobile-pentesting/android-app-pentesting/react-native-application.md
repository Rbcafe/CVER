# React Native Application Analysis

To confirm if the application was built on the React Native framework, follow these steps:

1. Rename the APK file with a zip extension and extract it to a new folder using the command `cp com.example.apk example-apk.zip` and `unzip -qq example-apk.zip -d ReactNative`.

2. Navigate to the newly created ReactNative folder and locate the assets folder. Inside this folder, you should find the file `index.android.bundle`, which contains the React JavaScript in a minified format.

3. Use the command `find . -print | grep -i ".bundle$"` to search for the JavaScript file.

To further analyze the JavaScript code, create a file named `index.html` in the same directory with the following code:

```html
<script src="./index.android.bundle"></script>
```

You can upload the file to [https://spaceraccoon.github.io/webpack-exploder/](https://spaceraccoon.github.io/webpack-exploder/) or follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in Google Chrome.

2. Open the Developer Toolbar by pressing **Command+Option+J for OS X** or **Control+Shift+J for Windows**.

3. Click on "Sources" in the Developer Toolbar. You should see a JavaScript file that is split into folders and files, making up the main bundle.

If you find a file called `index.android.bundle.map`, you will be able to analyze the source code in an unminified format. Map files contain source mapping, which allows you to map minified identifiers.

To search for sensitive credentials and endpoints, follow these steps:

1. Identify sensitive keywords to analyze the JavaScript code. React Native applications often use third-party services like Firebase, AWS S3 service endpoints, private keys, etc.

2. In this specific case, the application was observed to be using the Dialogflow service. Search for a pattern related to its configuration.

3. It was fortunate that sensitive hard-coded credentials were found in the JavaScript code during the recon process.
