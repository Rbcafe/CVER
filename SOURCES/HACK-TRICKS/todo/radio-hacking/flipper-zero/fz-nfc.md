## Intro <a href="#9wrzi" id="9wrzi"></a>

For info about RFID and NFC check the following page:

{% endcontent-ref %}

## Supported NFC cards <a href="#9wrzi" id="9wrzi"></a>

{% hint style="danger" %}
Apart from NFC cards Flipper Zero supports **other type of High-frequency cards** such as several **Mifare** Classic and Ultralight and **NTAG**.
{% endhint %}

New types of NFC cards will be added to the list of supported cards. Flipper Zero supports the following **NFC cards type A** (ISO 14443A):

* Ôªø**Bank cards (EMV)** ‚Äî only read UID, SAK, and ATQA without saving.
* Ôªø**Unknown cards** ‚Äî read (UID, SAK, ATQA) and emulate an UID.

For **NFC cards type B, type F, and type V**, Flipper Zero is able to read an UID without saving it.

### NFC cards type A <a href="#uvusf" id="uvusf"></a>

#### Bank card (EMV) <a href="#kzmrp" id="kzmrp"></a>

Flipper Zero can only read an UID, SAK, ATQA, and stored data on bank cards **without saving**.

#### Unknown cards <a href="#37eo8" id="37eo8"></a>

When Flipper Zero is **unable to determine NFC card's type**, then only an **UID, SAK, and ATQA** can be **read and saved**.

### NFC cards types B, F, and V <a href="#wyg51" id="wyg51"></a>

For **NFC cards types B, F, and V**, Flipper Zero can only **read and display an UID** without saving it.

## Actions

For an intro about NFC [**read this page**](../../../radio-hacking/pentesting-rfid.md#high-frequency-rfid-tags-13.56-mhz).

### Read

Flipper Zero can **read NFC cards**, however, it **doesn't understand all the protocols** that are based on ISO 14443. However, since **UID is a low-level attribute**, you might find yourself in a situation when **UID is already read, but the high-level data transfer protocol is still unknown**. You can read, emulate and manually input UID using Flipper for the primitive readers that use UID for authorization.

#### Reading the UID VS Reading the Data Inside <a href="#reading-the-uid-vs-reading-the-data-inside" id="reading-the-uid-vs-reading-the-data-inside"></a>

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In Flipper, reading 13.56 MHz tags can be divided into two parts:

* **Low-level read** ‚Äî reads only the UID, SAK, and ATQA. Flipper tries to guess the high-level protocol based on this data read from the card. You can't be 100% certain with this, as it is just an assumption based on certain factors.
* **High-level read** ‚Äî reads the data from the card's memory using a specific high-level protocol. That would be reading the data on a Mifare Ultralight, reading the sectors from a Mifare Classic, or reading the card's attributes from PayPass/Apple Pay.

### Read Specific

In case Flipper Zero isn't capable of finding the type of card from the low level data, in `Extra Actions` you can select `Read Specific Card Type` and **manually** **indicate the type of card you would like to read**.

#### EMV Bank Cards (PayPass, payWave, Apple Pay, Google Pay) <a href="#emv-bank-cards-paypass-paywave-apple-pay-google-pay" id="emv-bank-cards-paypass-paywave-apple-pay-google-pay"></a>

Apart from simply reading the UID, you can extract a lot more data from a bank card. It's possible to **get the full card number** (the 16 digits on the front of the card), **validity date**, and in some cases even the **owner's name** along with a list of the **most recent transactions**.\
However, you **can't read the CVV this way** (the 3 digits on the back of the card). Also **bank cards are protected from replay attacks**, so copying it with Flipper and then trying to emulate it to pay for something won't work.
