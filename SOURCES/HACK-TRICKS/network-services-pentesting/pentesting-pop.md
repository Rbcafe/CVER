## Basic Information

**Post Office Protocol (POP)** is described as a protocol within the realm of computer networking and the Internet, which is utilized for the extraction and **retrieval of email from a remote mail server**, making it accessible on the local device. Positioned within the application layer of the OSI model, this protocol enables users to fetch and receive email. The operation of **POP clients** typically involves establishing a connection to the mail server, downloading all messages, storing these messages locally on the client system, and subsequently removing them from the server. Although there are three iterations of this protocol, **POP3** stands out as the most prevalently employed version.


**Default ports:** 110, 995(ssl)

```
PORT    STATE SERVICE
110/tcp open  pop3
```

## Enumeration

### Banner Grabbing

```bash
nc -nv <IP> 110
openssl s_client -connect <IP>:995 -crlf -quiet
```

## Manual

You can use the command `CAPA` to obtain the capabilities of the POP3 server.

## Automated

```bash
nmap --script "pop3-capabilities or pop3-ntlm-info" -sV -port <PORT> <IP> #All are default scripts
```

The `pop3-ntlm-info` plugin will return some "**sensitive**" data (Windows versions).

### [POP3 bruteforce](../generic-methodologies-and-resources/brute-force.md#pop)

## POP syntax

POP commands examples from [here](http://sunnyoasis.com/services/emailviatelnet.html)

```bash
POP commands:
  USER uid           Log in as "uid"
  PASS password      Substitue "password" for your actual password
  STAT               List number of messages, total mailbox size
  LIST               List messages and sizes
  RETR n             Show message n
  DELE n             Mark message n for deletion
  RSET               Undo any changes
  QUIT               Logout (expunges messages if no RSET)
  TOP msg n          Show first n lines of message number msg
  CAPA               Get capabilities
```

Example:

```
root@kali:~# telnet $ip 110
 +OK beta POP3 server (JAMES POP3 Server 2.3.2) ready 
 USER billydean    
 +OK
 PASS password
 +OK Welcome billydean
