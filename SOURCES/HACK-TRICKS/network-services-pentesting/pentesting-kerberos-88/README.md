## Basic Information

**Kerberos** operates on a principle where it authenticates users without directly managing their access to resources. This is an important distinction because it underlines the protocol's role in security frameworks.

In environments like **Active Directory**, **Kerberos** is instrumental in establishing the identity of users by validating their secret passwords. This process ensures that each user's identity is confirmed before they interact with network resources. However, **Kerberos** does not extend its functionality to evaluate or enforce the permissions a user has over specific resources or services. Instead, it provides a secure way of authenticating users, which is a critical first step in the security process.

After authentication by **Kerberos**, the decision-making process regarding access to resources is delegated to individual services within the network. These services are then responsible for evaluating the authenticated user's rights and permissions, based on the information provided by **Kerberos** about the user's privileges. This design allows for a separation of concerns between authenticating the identity of users and managing their access rights, enabling a more flexible and secure approach to resource management in distributed networks.

**Default Port:** 88/tcp/udp

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE
88/tcp open  kerberos-sec
```

### MS14-068

The MS14-068 flaw permits an attacker to tamper with a legitimate user's Kerberos login token to falsely claim elevated privileges, such as being a Domain Admin. This counterfeit claim is mistakenly validated by the Domain Controller, enabling unauthorized access to network resources across the Active Directory forest.
