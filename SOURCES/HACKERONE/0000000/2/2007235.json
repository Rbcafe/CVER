  "vulnerability_information": "**Domain and URL:**\nhttp://███\nhttps://███████\nhttps://████/maximum-wiki-prod-app/\n\n**Summary:** \nFrom a single link I have access to a multitude of uploaded files on the server. All I have to do is search for keywords such as \"png\" or \"user\" and I can retrieve the target file without authentication, without blocking by the server, and without any particular effort. In short, users expose their files to anyone who has seen the public link.\n\n**Description:** [add more details about this vulnerability]\nI can download files, get personal information from users, view file extensions and view them directly in the browser from the link. I think the main vulnerability is that the site in question has given me free access to the xml file when I should simply be blocked.\n\n## Browsers Verified In:\nfirefox browser 113.0.2\nfirefox browser 102.11.0esr\nMicrosoft Edge 113.0.1774.57\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n  1.search on google : site:*.██████████\n  2. click on ████/login\n  3. in a linux machine, use an tool called \"gobuster\" on a terminal\n  4. type that commande on a terminal : gobuster dir -v -u https://███████ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt\n  5. You will see on the result : status: 301 -> https://████/uploads\n  6. In a teminal use a tool called \"curl\".\n  7. type that commande on a terminal : curl https://█████/uploads/\n  8. It returned : 403 Forbidden.\n  9. Put uppercase and lowercase to bypass it\n  10. type that commande on a terminal : curl https://██████/uPlOaDs/\n 11. Line : 103 you will see the vulnerable link : https://█████████/maximum-wiki-prod-app/uploads/images/system/2020-04/█████-Maximum_TMP_RGB-on_image.png\n  12. Go on : https://████████/maximum-wiki-prod-app/ you will see all of uploads files.\n\n## Known steps to resolve:\nblock the user when he try to get access to the vulnerable link\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can gain access to the website's tree structure, and thus obtain precise information to target his attacks. He could also extract information from users, and negotiate a ransom.",
