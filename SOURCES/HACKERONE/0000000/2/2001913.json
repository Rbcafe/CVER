  "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:**\nI hope you're well,\nHackerone recently changed from Zendesk to Freshdesk , that introduced this vulnerability , This asset is not in scope but the reason I'm reporting this because of the severity of this vulnerability as this can cause high impact on integrity of support desk.\n\n**Description:**\nThis vulnerability is similar to my previous finding [on Dropbox program](https://infosecwriteups.com/mail-server-misconfiguration-leads-to-sending-a-fax-from-anyones-account-on-hellofax-dropbox-bbp-aab3d97ab4e7?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------]) , So when we create a support ticket by sending email to support@hackerone.com then it creates a support ticket on Hackerone Support portal on Victim's support center account , I found that we can create support ticket on anyone's  by sending a fake email to support@hackerone.com , by putting victim's email in `FROM` field. This would create a support ticket on victim's account , attacker can use this to create miscellaneous tickets on anyone's account or they can create ticket on behalf of **Hackerone** staff. You can check the ticket (441828) , I created this ticket by sending a fake email.\nWe can use any fake emailer service for e.g https://emkei.cz/\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Go to https://emkei.cz/\n2. Put victim's email in `From E-mail:\t` field and support@hackerone.com in `To:` field\n3. Enter anything in name , content , subject and click Send\n\n██████\n\n* Now a ticket would be created on behalf of victim\n\n## Impact\n\n* Using this bug an attacker can create miscellaneous tickets on behalf of victim or create unnecessary noise on victim's support desk account\n* Attacker can create internal ticket on behalf of HackerOne employees\n\nBest Regards\n**Sayaan Alam**",

To contact us, please use our HackerOne Support Portal, https://support.hackerone.com/support/home.\n\nbut it would also create a ticket.\n\nThe hackers reporting #2068830, #2082680 caused us to take another look at this previously informative report (as it was a dupe, and then we realised it was actually different systems: email vs the actual support tool), so we chose to award both. \n\nWe later discovered this was already mitigated internally - we already ensured it was resolved so nobody took a look at it, but now we also delete the ticket created. \n\nSomething that's different from usual reports we get is that this was an asset not considered in scope, so we didn't have a concrete bounty table and it brought our team to the drawing board on how we want to handle such reports. Whilst we want to encourage hackers to hack on non-listed assets belonging to us, and also out-of-scope assets (i.e. for managed services) that are on us, such as misconfigurations or information disclosure.\n\nCurrently, it's not something we have clear guidelines for. We opted to give a bonus without bounty instead to speed the process along.",
