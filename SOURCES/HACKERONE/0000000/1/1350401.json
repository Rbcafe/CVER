So i reported it again.\n\nFirst Vulnerability : Email verification Bypass-\nSummary:\nIn this vulnerability you can verify any email without verification link. (reddit.com and ads.reddit.com)\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\nEmail that i wants to verify example : security12345@reddit.com\n1. Signup an account with direct “continue with google” with your own email.\n2. Go to User Settings and click on \"Change\" in email section.  it will send you a password reset link before changing email because you signed up an account with google without giving a password. So first you need to reset your account password. (now you can disconnect the google accountif you wants.)\n3. After changing password change the email to any other random email like 12332newtestemail@sstestmail.com.\n4.

Open the link in new incognito tab and enter all details. on email field enter victim’s email that you wants to verify, enter any ramdom password in  current password field and then set new password that you wants to use for this account.\n6. Click on Submit button 4 Times because it will give error on 3 attempt.\n7. You can see your entered email has been verified.\n\nIn Previous report you said its just UI bug but its not only UI bug beacuse  i can use that account(created from above steps) in ads.reddit.com. Normally ads.reddit.com not working with unverified account. But here i can use that account for all of your services as a verified account.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSecond Vulnerability : Get access to user's private invitations\nDescription :\nin ad account if you invites someone as with admin or other permissions. it will send invite to user in https://ads.reddit.com/account/userid/accounts. it can be access by another account that have same verified email.\nSteps to reproduce :\n1.
