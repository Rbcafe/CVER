This presents a serious security risk, as an attacker could use this information to gain access to sensitive files or directories that should not be publicly available.\n\n## Impact\n\n* Loss of confidentiality: The disclosure of internal username and webroot directories can result in a loss of confidentiality of sensitive information. This can lead to unauthorized access, manipulation, or exploitation of the disclosed information.\n\n* Social engineering attacks: Internal username can be used in social engineering attacks such as phishing, spear-phishing, or pretexting. Attackers can use this information to craft targeted emails or other communications that appear to come from a trusted source and attempt to deceive the recipient into divulging sensitive information or clicking on malicious links.\n\n* Reputation damage: The disclosure of sensitive information can damage an organization's reputation and erode trust among customers, partners, and stakeholders.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7049404669814530048/\n\n## System Host(s)\n████████\n\n## Affected Product(s) and Version(s)\n\n\n## CVE Numbers\n\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n* Visit : ███, █████\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7049404669814530048/\n\n",
