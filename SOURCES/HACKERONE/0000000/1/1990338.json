  "vulnerability_information": "Hi DoD Team, \nI hope you are doing good today.\n\nThis is a follow-up from my  November 15th 2022 report number #1775217 (https://hackerone.com/reports/1775217)\nIn all respect and to be clear, I don't want to push too hard or be annoying on this and feel free to tell me if you don't want or need to take action on this.\n\nSince my report #1775217 was left un-answered I felt I should open a new one since I feel this is serious matter.\n\n>>Recap of my last report : \n>>On November 15th 2022: I opened a report describing how I've found a set of credential publicly exposed from an ITSM system indexed in search engines.\n>> On November 16th 2022 :I had a reply telling me that the credentials were valid but didn't have any rights on the system so there was no impact.\n>> On November 17th2022 :  I had found another set of credentials exposed and I was able to successfully exploit CVE-2018-18862 from this.\n>>This was left un-answered.\n>>On February 12th 2023: The website was down and I left my report as such.\n>>See : https://hackerone.com/reports/1775217 for all the details.\n\n\nToday, to my surprise and while doing other searches I stumbled accross this website again.\nI would like to reiterate the following : \n\n\n>Today, May 16th 2023, the set of Credentials I had found at the time are still working :\n>>**Username:** ████\n>>**Password:** ███\n\n>>**Username:** ████████\n>>**Password:** ██████████\n\nSee screenshot 3, taken on May 16th 2023, the \"█████████\" credentials are still exposed.\n█████\n\nHere is the login page : https://████████/███████/shared/login.jsp\n \nToday, May 16th 2023, I can still successfully exploit **CVE-2018-18862 - Incorrect access control**.\n\nI decided to re-open the report for the following reasons : \n-I thought about it a long time, since on my prior report I didn't have any reply after the successful CVE exploitation and the new set of credentials found I judged it was worth having a 2nd look.\n-Also, I thought the system was down but today I found out it was not.\n\n\nIn all good faith.\nBest regards.\n\n\n~pll25\n\n\n## References\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18862\n\n## Impact\n\n-An attacker can access the system with the rights of these users.\n-I was able to list Roles. \n-I am potentially able to create/read reports and probably do more but I stopped there because the POC is already proven.\n-2 sets of credentials including valid username and passwords were leaked from this system on November 15th 2022.\n\n## System Host(s)\nhttps://███████\n\n## Affected Product(s) and Version(s)\nBMC Remedy version unknown\n\n## CVE Numbers\nCVE-2018-18862 - (CVSS V3.0 Score : 8.8 (HIGH), Vector: /AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n**Step 1:** \nLet's say we use the account \"██████████\". \nLogin with the username and password on this page : https://██████/███/shared/login.jsp \n(ScreenShot 1 from November 15th describes how I was able to obtain it).\n███\n\n**Step 2 :** \n You should land on an Error web page telling that the file doesn't exist.\nThe landing URL should look like this : \n>>███████/█████/forms/arpcp/**arpc:web:retirementsapplicationsubmission/default+administrator+view/$external%20report%20server%20url_glb$retirementapplication&rs:command=render&preportinstanceid=$536871212$&rs:format=pdf**\n\n**Step 3 :** \nHere we can exploit CVE-2018-18862 : replace all the text after : /forms/arpc/ (the part of the URL in bold above) with :\n>>/User/Default+Admin+View1/\n\n**Step 4:** \nYou will now have access to the whole Remedy ITSM system.\nFrom there you have successfully exploited CVE-2018-18862.\n\nI was able to list Roles. \nI am potentially able to create/read reports and probably do more but I stopped there because the POC is already proven.\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\n- Change affected passwords. \n- MIgrate the system to a new un-affected version.\n- Apply the vendor work-arounds if possible.\n\n",
