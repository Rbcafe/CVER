  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary:\nWhen considering reuse of existing connections different `CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION` (libcurl) `--delegation` (curl)  option is not taken into consideration. This can lead to reuse of previously established connection when it should no longer be (as more strict or no delegation was requested).\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1.  `curl --negotiate -u : --delegation \"always\" https://server/path -: --negotiate -u : --delegation \"none\" https://server/path`\n\n## Remediation\n\n- Safest option is to not reuse connections if different `CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION` levels are being used. It **might** also be correct to not reuse connections with \"laxer\" `CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION`: \"none\" should only allow reusing \"none\" level, \"policy\" should only allow \"none\" or \"policy\" level, while \"always\" can reuse all connections otherwise deemed appropriate for reuse.\n\n## Impact\n\nExisting connection that was established via more lax delegation will be reused for connection that should not succeed due to more restrictive delegation requested. The practical impact can vary, but I believe it is likely quite low, as it should be quite rare to have connections attempted with mixed delegation policies like this.",
