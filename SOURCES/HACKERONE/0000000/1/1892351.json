  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary:\nlibcurl `Curl_getworkingpath` function resolves `~` as remote users' home directory. This routine behaves in an undocumented way for `sftp` protocol. In particular it is said that `/~/` is converted to remote user's home directory (*1), while this isn't how the function actually behaves. This can lead to unexpected final path for the `sftp` access, and allow an attacker with partial path access to gain access to untended remote system path locations.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. access `sftp://host/~a../other/file`\n  2. remote path will result as: `/home/user/../other/file`\n\nIt's notable that when `~a..` path component is checked for path traversal via normal unix path resolving rules, the path component is **not** considered accessing a parent directory, and thus will bypass path sanitization operations attempting to disallow access to parent directory. As an additional remark, in regular UNIXy world `~user/`  specifies another users' home directory, which clearly is not supported by `sftp`. This adds to potential confusion.\n\n## Remediation\n- In `Curl_getworkingpath` convert `~` in `sftp` paths only when  either `/~/` or `/~` (if it is the full path) is used. Reject `~<something>` paths (or don't convert them).\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n1) https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/scpsftp\n\n## Impact\n\nBypassing application implemented path filtering.",
