I have also agreements the day before I sent the report.\n\nThis db contains all agreements signed on legium.io including any company and it's almost 325 MB \n\nYou were connecting to this database from legium.corp.mail.ru and users also did that, https://legium-back.corp.mail.ru is the same as api.legium.io, how they could create or upload the same script on your servers, and not mcs.mail.ru one, it's the *.corp.mail.ru.\nImpossible to have the same credentials you did for https://legium.corp.mail.ru as the crendentials for the main subdomain api.legium.io where the database is .\nall legium data are stored on the same database.\n\nThe db credentials was founded on ext.A subdomain. Not ext.O\n\nall URLs of images are on the database : the Same URls from \"legium-data\" S3 bucket\n\nI added also a screenshot about legium.corp.mail.ru, that legium.io signing agreements for Mailru Group.\nand also https://skillbox.legium.io => belongs to Skillbox.ru => Mailru informations there too\n\n@aleks_grishin said that \"Legium and Mail.Ru Group not partners and there is no reward for this data.\" And you have no relation with the ip where database i accessed, why you just didn't close the report as N/A as you did with my old reports when its out of scope?\n{F1437100} \n\n@aleks_grishin, @kpebetka triaged the report without changing the scope,then you changed the scope, the he changed it again.  Do you guys don't know what your scope is? \n\nNo one knows Mailru's scope more than @kpebetka, but he confirmed the scope at the 1st time and always did it \n\n\n#My report wasn't treated fairly. this db isn't for testing or contains informations related to MailRu",
