  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary\nHi there, assuming you want this report as your policy mentions Affirm resources with third-parties, but the scope was a little unclear. Regardless, www█████.affirm.com points to an AWS S3 bucket `affirm-prod-www-cms█████████` that no longer exists. I was able to take control of this bucket and put my own content onto it. I can now serve content on this domain, obtain a TLS certificate for this domain, etc.\n\nIf any customers or servers are pointing to anything within this domain, I could serve them arbitrary/malicious content. I could also use this in case your domain whitelists your own domain for OAuth, or if there are cookies scoped to the entire domain. Usually this can have a high impact.\n\n**Note:** S3 has a weird quirk where the bucket's region may cause errors if a request to a bucket is addressed to the wrong region. I assume your CDN points to `████-2`, but my bucket is in `us-east-1`. When you make a request to this domain, S3 shows a redirect error because of this. If I wanted to move the bucket to the correct region (for the PoC to fully work), it would put it at risk of being claimed by attackers/others. Hopefully, this is enough for you.\n\n### PoC\nTo see that the domain points to the `affirm-prod-www-cms█████` bucket:\n\n```\n% curl https://www██████████.affirm.com\n[...]\n<Code>PermanentRedirect</Code>\n<Message>The bucket you are attempting to access must be addressed using the specified endpoint. Please send all future requests to this endpoint.</Message>\n<Endpoint>s3.amazonaws.com</Endpoint>\n<Bucket>affirm-prod-www-cms████</Bucket>\n[...]\n```\n\nFollowing this redirect, to see the PoC:\n```\n% curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/affirm-prod-www-cms████████/index.html\n<!-- taken over by hackerone.com/ian bugcrowd.com/iangcarroll ian@lhost.sh -->\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nSubdomain takeover",
