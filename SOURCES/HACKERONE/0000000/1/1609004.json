  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary:\nIt is a vulnerability which can prove to be critical when misused by attackers ,rate limit is a flaw that doesn't limit the no. of attempts one makes on a website server. this vulnerability makes the website more susceptible to brute force the username while keeping the password constant that is ,, <same password>:<diff. username>,\n secondly it also make susceptible to brute force the <diff. username>:<diff. password>. Please refer to my Conclusion below:\n\n## Impact:\nNo rate limit means their is no mechanism to protect against the requests you made in a short frame of time . Hence the hacker can brute force the Login page of Reddit , he may also gain easy access to user accounts , it has a lot of chances to flood the server with lot of requests\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. NOTE : as we know we are not allowed to brute force , therefore i generated 20 random accounts and did manual login as well as few automated logins. \n \nI CAME TO CONCLUSION :\n\nMECHANISM OF RATE LIMIT ON REDDIT##\n\n1.SAME USERNAME DIFF PASS: RATE LIMIT IS WORKING\n\n2.DIFF USERNAME , SAME PASS : RATE LIMIT IS  NOT WORKING\n3.REDDIT IS NOT RESTRICTING THE IP ADDRESS , NEITHER THERE IS TIME DELAY IN MAKING REQUEST\n4.DIFFERENT USERNAME , DIFF PASS AREN'T RESTTRICTED , CAN DEFINATELY LEAD TO DDOS OR BRUTEFORCE ATTACK\n\n## Impact\n\nthis vulnerability making the website more susceptible to brute force which may also lead to gaining unauthorized access to users account.",
