  "vulnerability_information": "### Details\nUnfortunately, I wasn't able to properly validate the following report as I could not get access the my partner's services option (event is ending in a few hours) and that access is manually given (https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/selling-services). However, given the observed behaviour, I assume there's a high probability of this being a missing permission check.\n\nWithin a partner's organization, financial datas are gated by the **View financials** permission. However, I observed that a staff with no permission is able to retrieve **Services** financial.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n#### Partner's organization owner\n1. Create a Partner's account on https://partners.shopify.com\n1. Invite a team member with no permissions (go to **Teams > Invite staff member**, select no permission and complete the invite)\n\n#### Partner's staff member with no permission\n1. Accept the invite and log-in to the partner's dashboard\n1. In the upper right corner, click on the notification bell image and intercept the GraphQL request being made to https://partners.shopify.com/:id/api/graphql\n1. Update the payload to the following:\n```\n{\n   \"query\":\"{ serviceMetrics { totalEarnings { amount } } }\"\n}\n```\n\nAs a result, you will be returned the financial data:\n```\n{\n   \"data\":{\n      \"serviceMetrics\":{\n         \"totalEarnings\":{\n            \"amount\":\"0.0\"\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\nAssuming that this property should be gated by the **View financials** permission,  I should have received an access denied there instead of an amount (being `0.00` in my case as there's no data).\n\n## Impact\n\nStaff with no permissions, specifically the **View financials** is able to access **Services** financial data",
