  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary:\n\nA vulnerability in the Brave Browser v1.28.43 and below allows a local or physical attacker to view the exact timestamps that a user connected to a v2 onion address. A local or physical attacker could read  ~/.config/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/tor/data/tor.log identify the exact moment a user connected to a new site, easily triangulating the user via a complete log of connection timestamps, which could be easily compared with a server connection log, a compromised Tor end point, or other related Tor attack, affecting the confidentiality & integrity of a user's Tor session.\n\n## Products affected: \n\n * operating system, Brave version or Brave website page, etc.\n\nTor Desktop Browser (All platforms)\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n * List the steps needed to reproduce the vulnerability\n\nVisit http://wikitoronionlinks.com/ while using Tor Private Browsing.\n\nClick on an assortment of .onion v2 URLs.\n\nInspect `~/.config/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/tor/data/tor.log`\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n```\nJul 01 08:40:50.000 [warn] Warning!
