  "vulnerability_information": "Hello Team,\n\nHope you are doing great and enjoying a lot. \nThis issue affected me directly and I was very amazed by it, so I felt it was important to report it in case it was not known. It is resulting unintended behavior:\n\nIn addition to this report is very similar to both of already been Resolved hackerone reports\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/238260\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/1278261\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Install The Mattermost Desktop App for Windows (64-bit).\n2) Enter the Display name with Server URL\n3) Login to Mattermost Desktop App\n4) Uninstall Mattermost Desktop App\n5) Reinstall Mattermost Desktop App\n\nConclusion: You will automatically be logged back in to your account, even though you uninstalled Mattermost Desktop App from your computer and did not enter a username/password to login to the fresh Mattermost Desktop App installation.\n\nThanks and have a good day ;)\nRegards\n@annonmous\n\n## Impact\n\nThe Mattermost Desktop App uninstall process is fully automatic, there is no prompt or indication that there is data left behind. I believe it is reasonable to expect that when uninstalling Mattermost Desktop App users session data should have been removed. If I am a user on a shared user account (for example, if I borrowed a computer and I installed Mattermost Desktop App, but uninstalled it later), they can take full control of my account after the fact.\n\nWhen testing this, I could access all of my messages and data, and even access the Mattermost Desktop App admin panel for my team that I am an administrator of.",
