  "vulnerability_information": "Hi,\n\nI think this is more of a privacy concern than a security concern. However I wanted to check here first. Please direct me to an other suitable location if needed.\n\nIt is in relation to https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/master/lib/private/Updater/VersionCheck.php#L78\n\nThis is sending several things related to servers to Nextcloud. Especially the 'installedat' seems to have a very high likely hood to be unique for an instance. Allowing Nextcloud to track instances when doing the requests.\n\nI especially wonder why you chose this method here. Instead of the 'appstore' approach were you just have an big blob and have the server figure everything out.\n\nOther than that I could not find any mention about what data is send to Nextclouds servers and why.  One could argue that pinging the updates.nextcloud.com has a legitimate reason. However I doubt that regarding the more track sensitive information. And even then it would be OK if you'd communicate about this clearly.\n\nAgain sorry if this is the wrong place. But I didn't wanna post this publicly if it is in any way sensitive.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis could potentially cause legal issues if you are sending data that is not needed and identifiable.",
