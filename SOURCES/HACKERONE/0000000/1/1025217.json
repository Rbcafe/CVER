  "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:**\nPublicly exposed website (███████) offering default login user/pass with expired SSL\n\n**Description:**\nhttps://██████/ is branded as '████' with ██████ branding/logo and links to ██████ homepage, defense.gov & @DeptofDefense (Twitter account)\n\n## Impact\nPublicly exposed service with potentially default credentials listed on homepage that may allow access\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n1. Browse to: https://█████/\n2. Note that the cert for this site is expired as of 2nd Jan 2020, and references the FQDN as: █████\n3. The same site is also available on port 8080 without the cert - http://██████:8080/\n(see attached image that references the default accounts/password that may be used: kiosk/kiosk, user/user)\n4. The 'registration' page suggest admin/admin as the Administrator account - https://███████/register\n5. This URL references '█████████', who appear to be a US Govt services company - https://███/management/info\n\n## Product, Version, and Configuration (If applicable)\nUnknown. Branding on the homepage page reports '███████ v0.0.1-SNAPSHOT' and has '███████' logo\n\nInfo taken from: https://█████████/management/info\nDisplays following:\n{\"display-ribbon-on-profiles\":\"dev\",\"git\":{\"commit\":{\"id\":{\"abbrev\":\"a91feef\",\"describe\":\"a91feef-dirty\"}},\"branch\":\"develop\"},\"build\":{\"version\":\"0.0.1-SNAPSHOT\",\"artifact\":\"███████\",\"name\":\"██████████\",\"group\":\"com.perspecta.idam\",\"time\":\"2019-10-07T22:00:08.050Z\"},\"activeProfiles\":[\"prod\"]}\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\n1. Update TLS/SSL cert\n2. Secure default accounts.\n3. If a test/demo site - take down or hide from public access.\n\nAs referenced above, I don't know that this is a valid/active DoD/█████████ resesource. The expired certificated references it as '████████'. However, with the obvious DoD/██████ references on the page I thought it safer to raise a report.\nDue to this, I have not carried out any actions other than visiting this page and have not attempted to login using the credentials offered.\n\nIf this isn't an active DoD/████████ resource (likely), it could be intended for phishing / credential theft from legitimate users directed towarsds it.\n\n## Impact\n\nI don't know if the default credentials offered (kiosk/kiosk, user/user or admin/admin) work, or what may sit behind this site.\nI suspect it is a simply a test/demo/UAT that has been left exposed by the Devs.",
