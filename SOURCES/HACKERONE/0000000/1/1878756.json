And there are a lot of emails that are internal information about your organisation.\n\nThat should not be known to the public. An attacker can copy those emails and then they can do email spoofing or email\n\nbombing with those emails. If an attacker can use those emails he/she then can send messages, not from your organisation. He or she can write\n\nbad messages or wrong messages or false messages or scam messages to those victims. They can make a reputation loss.\n\nThey can send harmful news/false news/malicious files. They can do phishing attacks and steal the internal information of your organisation.\n\nSometimes it may occur different types of account hacks.\n\n## System Host(s)\n███████\n\n## Affected Product(s) and Version(s)\n\n\n## CVE Numbers\n\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\nYou must upload the PHP file to the public HTML.\n\nI created this PHP code for testing.
