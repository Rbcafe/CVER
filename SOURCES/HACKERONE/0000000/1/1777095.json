      "content": "As LinkedIn is heavily used by recruiters across the globe there are billions of resumes stored in the system.\n \nThere are several ways how resumes can be added to LinkedIn:\n-\tCase 1 - when candidate apply to the job post through LinkedIn “Easy Apply” feature and attach resume to the application. In this case access to this resume granted to applicant himself, recruiter who posted specific job on LinkedIn and potentially other recruiters from the company candidate applied to (if the company uses LinkedIn Recruiter product).\n-\tCase 2 - resume can be added to specific LinkedIn profile by recruiter within LinkedIn Recruiter product (tool similar to Applicant Tracking System). In this case access to this resume granted to recruiter who uploaded resume and potentially other recruiters from the same company.\n\nBecause of the discovered vulnerability the attacker had a possibility to iterate file IDs and get access to resumes of applicants who either apply to different LinkedIn job posts (case 1) or resumes of professionals which were uploaded to LinkedIn by recruiters (case 2 - without actual candidate application).\n\nLinkedIn security team was very reactive for this report so vulnerability was fixed within very short timeframe.
