  "vulnerability_information": "Hi Khan Academy Team,\n\nI was able to bypass the fix you implemented for report #1078283. \n\nThe URL validation you implemented on the endpoint `continue` checks the presence of `khanacademy.org` however it doesn't have any boundary checking to ignore domains starting with `.org`, so if an attacker register a domain starting with `org` like this one `orghacker.com.br` and have a subdomain entry of `khanacademy` the attacker is able to bypass the current implementation and lead the victim to his controlled page.\n\n# Steps to reproduce the issue\n\n* Go to this page https://www.khanacademy.org/signup?isteacher=1&referral=LearnStorm&continue=https://khanacademy.orghacker.com.br\n* You'll be redirected to `orghacker.com.br` which is not a domain that Khan Academy owns\n\n## Impact\n\nBypass of current URL validation. Attacker can send a phishing campaign and redirect the request to a server of his control. An attacker might chain the attack to other types of attack too.",
