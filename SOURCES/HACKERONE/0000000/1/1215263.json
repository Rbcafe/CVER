  "vulnerability_information": "Description\n-----------\n\nWhen downloading mail attachments, the app fails to properly escape quotes in the content disposition header. Because of this, an attacker can send a victim a file with a benign extension such as `.txt` or `.png` which when downloaded will be stored with a malicious extension such as `.bat` or `.docm`. \n\nThis vulnerability can for example be exploited in the following scenarios:\n\n- It allows bypassing of extension-based attachment filtering by email providers (or other intermediate email systems), as is common in many networks.\n- As the attachment is displayed as a benign file in Nextcloud, a user may incorrectly trust it to be a benign file.\n\n\nPOC\n---\n\n- Send a mail to an email address that is connected to Nextcloud Mail with an attached file called `test.bat\".png`. \n- open the mail -> click on the attachment icon -> click on the download icon. While Nextcloud correctly displays the file as a benign `.png` file, it will be downloaded as `test.bat` instead.  \n\nTested with Firefox under Windows.\n\nAs alternative to `.bat` files (which may be prevented from executing by Microsoft Defender SmartScreen), an attacker can also send other malicious files such as for example `.vbs` files, as well as `.docm` files containing macro viruses.\n\n\nRequest\n-------\n\n```\n    GET /nextcloud/index.php/apps/mail/api/messages/26/attachment/2 HTTP/1.1\n    Host: 192.168.0.101\n\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    [...]\n    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"test.bat\".png\"\n    [...]\n    Content-Type: application/octet-stream\n\n    C:\\Windows\\system32\\calc.exe\n```\n\nSolution\n--------\n\nQuotes should be properly escaped before being inserted into the Content-Disposition header.\n\n## Impact\n\nOffering malicious files for download, leading to code execution on the computer of the victim if they download and open the file.",
