For example,\n\nprivate def check(param)\n  case param\n  when \"valid\"\n    param\n  else\n    \"/\"\n  end\nend\n\ndef index\n  redirect_to(check(params[:some_param]))\nend\nOr force the user input to be cast to a string like this,\n\ndef index\n  redirect_to(params[:some_param].to_s)\nend\nPatches\nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for\nthe two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a\nsingle changeset.\n\n5-2-information-disclosure.patch - Patch for 5.2 series\n6-0-information-disclosure.patch - Patch for 6.0 series\n6-1-information-disclosure.patch - Patch for 6.1 series\nPlease note that only the 5.2, 6.0, and 6.1 series are supported at present. Users\nof earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we\ncannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported\nreleases.\n\nCredits\nThanks to Benoit Côté-Jodoin from Shopify for reporting this.\n\nReferences\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/releases/tag/v5.2.4.6\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/releases/tag/v5.2.6\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/releases/tag/v6.0.3.7\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/releases/tag/v6.1.3.2\nhttps://groups.google.com/g/rubyonrails-security/c/NiQl-48cXYI",
