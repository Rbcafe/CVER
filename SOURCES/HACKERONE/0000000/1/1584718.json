  "vulnerability_information": "In the review on apps.shopify.com the Google sales channel has a review of 5407 but the actual number of shopify stores that use the Google channel I believe is more than that number so I think this vulnerability can have an impact on many shopify stores and here I found a vulnerability where attackers can exploit every shopify store that has a Google Sales channel even though the store is in Password protection\n\n1. Install google channel at your-store.myshopify.com\n2. Enable password protection at your-store.myshopify.com\n3. Add new product in shopify store\n4. Now go to this link : google-shopping.shopifycloud.com/shopify/products?shop=your-store.myshopify.com&id=PRODUCT ID&locale=en\nChange PRODUCT ID with your shopify product id\n5. Now in the response you will see information disclosure in the form of data-channel-id and data-user-email\n\n```\ndata-channel-id=\"70715703461\"\ndata-user-email=\"VICTIMEMAIL@gmail.com\"\n```\n\nEven though the shopify store which is in a password protected state is very private, but in this vulnerability the attacker can still find out sensitive information from the shopify store which is in a password protected state.\nStores that do not have a password protected are easier to exploit because attackers can get the product id of the victim's store\n\n## Impact\n\nVulnerabilities that allow attackers to get sensitive information from victim stores",
