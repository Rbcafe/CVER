But who's going to do that work?\n\nMaybe we shouldn't ship Darkfish if nobody can update it?\n\nWhat do people think should be done? I ship my own implementation of Ruby and I'm not happy with shipping this old version so may have to remove Darkfish myself.\n\n## Impact\n\nLow. Possibly a risk that someone includes RDoc generated HTML on their site and accidentally uses this jQuery for the rest of their site and makes themselves vulnerable to the CVEs.",
