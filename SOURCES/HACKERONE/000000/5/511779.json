This means that even after a report has moved, the report is referencing an object that may not belong to a program the user controls.\n\n# Proof of concept\n\n* Submit a report to a program where you have the ability to move the report to another program\n* Move the report to a program you also have access to\n* Confirm through the Rails console that the report references values that belong to the program the report was submitted to\n\n## Impact\n\nThe associated values and attributes may leak confidential information, either through the value itself or updating the attributes at a later point in time.",
