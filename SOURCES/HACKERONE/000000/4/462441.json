Once the user open up NC app, content get automatically reuploaded to sever.\n\nAs it seems NEW content does not get uploaded nor DELETED content get removed, it seems that Nextcloud app maintain a local sync setup and this setup could be used for metadata control to at least prevent/control data re-upload.\n\nif Nextcloud lock is setup, it would also good to at least provide a minimal confidentiality setup so that data gets encrypted PER default and decrpyted on tmp folder only on click (which is required to open assets with PDF/other app).",
