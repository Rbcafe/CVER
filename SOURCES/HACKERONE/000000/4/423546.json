  "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:**\n\nBy default, Shopify Wholesale customers are prevented from immediately checking out:\n\n{F360280}\n\nInstead, a store admin must approve each order before the customer can pay.\n\nThis restriction can be bypassed, allowing a customer to check out orders without prior approval. This also bypasses any maximum checkout amount that a store can set.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. As a Wholesale owner, ensure that a customer is disallowed from immediately checking out at https://your-store.myshopify.com/admin/apps/wholesale/admin/shops/x/accounts.\n  1. As the customer, visit the Wholesale shop and fill your cart with products.\n  1. Observe that the UI forces the user to submit a purchase order:\n\n    {F360285}\n\n  1. To bypass this restriction, intercept the request to `PUT /purchase_orders/submit` to submit the purchase order and change the url to `/purchase_orders/update_checkout`.\n  1. Observe that executing the request will allow the customer to proceed through the checkout flow and place the order:\n\n{F360296}\n\n## Impact\n\nThis allows a customer to bypass manual approval restrictions for a Wholesale store and immediately check out.",
