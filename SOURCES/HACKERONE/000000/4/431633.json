  "vulnerability_information": "Hi,\n\nA STAFF with just `Settings` permission can only create 1 type of webhook called `Shop Update` as seen below.\n\n{F368739}\n\nAttempting to create a `Order Creation` webhook via burp proxy gives a 403 -Forbidden response with the message indicating that `You do not have permission to create webhooks with orders/create ` as seen below.\n\n{F368743}\n\nSo technically from the above results it means that any STAFF with just `Settings` permission is restricted to create any webhooks related to `Order` or __make modifications/deletions to Order webhooks__ created by Owner or other permitted users.\n\nFrom my testing I observed that a STAFF member with just `Settings` only permission could modify `Order` webhooks if the web-hooks were created previously by Owner or other permitted users. These Order webhooks can also be deleted by the STAFF member.\n\n__STEPS__\n\n1.Onwer assigns `Settings` only permission to STAFF.\n2.Owner creates a webhook for `Order Creation`.\n{F368756}\n{F368757}\n3.STAFF logs into Store Admin and then navigates to Settings>>Notifications. STAFF can see the `Order Creation` webhook which was created by Owner.\n{F368758}\n4.STAFF then clicks on the wehbook. This opens a modal box where STAFF can make modifications in he URL. STAFF then clicks on `Save Webhook`\n{F368759}\n{F368760}\nAs you can see from the above screen shot, the `Order creation` webhook was modified by STAFF.\n\n5.The STAFF can also delete a `Order Creation` webhook.\n{F368762}\n{F368763}\n\n## Impact\n\nFrom my previous report #430285, @jack_mccracken stated the below\n\n>Order notifications are restricted to staff members with the `Orders` permission.\n\nA Webhook is technically an event which is which triggered due to some activity. In this case, the event `Order Creation` webhook will trigger a notification to the specified URL in webhook. The fact that a STAFF user with just `Settings` permission isn't allowed to create a `Order Creation` webhook indicates that the STAFF must also need `Orders` permission to create it.\n\nBut from my testing, it was possible for a STAFF with just `Settings` permission to edit/delete a `Order Creation` webhook which IMO should not be authorized to the STAFF member.\n\nLet me know what you think about it.\n\nThanks.\n@h13-",
