  "vulnerability_information": "Hey Team\n\n \n\nI have some observations and issues which i found in my recent testing on h1 platform ( related to creation of a new private program ), So  here are my observations listed below - kindly have a look and revert back if you feel like these are valid and worth reporting issues.\n\n\n1) Can A program without fully verified status have report retest feature active - (  Unnecessary disturbing the hackers of h1  - as the feature itself says that hackers will be paid 100$ for retest but here the program itself is not verified so who will be accountable to pay this 100$  )\n\n \n\nI actually made a test program with handle  \" █████ \" ,  resolved a report onto it and then initiated the \"Report Retest\" feature which sent invitation to 5 hackers ( 2 of them actually tested and replied back )\n\n \n\nNow current status of my test program \"████████\" is :\n\n \n\n{{\n \n\nA few items have prevented your program from being validated at this time. Please reach out to support@hackerone.com if you haven't received a message with next steps.\n\n \n\nEmail content :::\n\n \n\nHi 3thic4l,\n\nThanks very much for reaching out to HackerOne. I see you have requested to invite hackers and go live with a private program.\n\nAfter review, your program (████████) is missing some key required elements for approval. In order to start a HackerOne program, you must have:\n\n•             A valid Disclosure Policy that aligns with your reward structure\n\n•             A valid attack surface for researchers to hack that is defined in your program's scope\n\n•             A verified email address that matches your company domain\n\n•             Our security team reserves the right to disallow any company whose properties it deems incompatible with the HackerOne program.\n\nBest,\n\nHackerOne Team\n\n \n\n \n\nYour program is missing some required elements for approval.\n\nSee email from support@hackerone.com for additional detail.\n\n \n\n}}\n\n And also 3 out of 5 researchers who got invited for retest are actually paid 100$ each , so I am not sure Weather it's intended feature or some bug.\n\n2) Email bombing ( excessive spamming - I sent 50 mails in 1 minute using wearehackerone email handle ) in add participant  : ████████\n\nIts like if a program sends an invitation to example@wearehackerone.com , then by using burp intruder multiple invitation email could be sent by altering address as example+1@wearehackerone.com  and so on.\n\n \n\n3) No rate limit on group creation in a program : ████  ( Not really a security issue but there should be some rate limit - As i was able to create 20 groups in 5 secs through burp intruder )\n\n \n\n4) Report Retest feature invites 5 hackers - now i am curious to know weather country check is in place in this feature ( ████ )\n\n \n\nWaiting for your reply on the above mentioned issues.\n\nNote : ( My user handle = 3thic4l  )\n\n \n\nRegards\n\nAhmad\n\n## Impact\n\nMonetary loss to h1 -  coz the person/company accountable is not yet verified.",
