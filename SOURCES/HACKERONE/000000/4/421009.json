  "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:** \n\n[Exchange Marketplace](https://exchangemarketplace.com/) allows Shop owners to sell their business in a easy way. When placing the shop in the listings, the owner has the option to place their store as a private listing - where only stats will be displayed, and no information about the actual Shop, domain name or shop owned are visible.\n\nInspecting the source code I discovered a <script> element generated by [Hypernova](https://github.com/airbnb/hypernova) which discloses the aforementioned private data:\n- Shop ID\n- Shop Owner name\n- Shop owner email\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\nTo find the script, first pick a private listing e.g. [930273](https://exchangemarketplace.com/shops/e834b11e056bd114f8262d0464a512c9). Then search the DOM for a <script> element containing the 'data-hypernova-key' string:\n\n {F357502} \n\nWe'll have a long JSON available containing the variables mentioned:\n\n{F357509}\n\n{F357510} \n\nThis only discloses some data, but it's enough to pinpoint what the real Shop is, using some recon.\n\nThe first method is with open intel - we have the Shop owner name and email. Most of the business will be registered in Linkedin so, a search there or using Google should be suffice to have a match.\n\nThe second method is much more reliable and can be made via multiple ways, let's describe the easiest.  Firstly, an attacker downloads a dataset of all known websites using Shopify, using something like [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com) or [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com):\n\n{F357514} \n\nWith that dataset he'll fetch every page and observe the response headers, where the X-ShopId header is present:\n\n{F357515} \n\nNow the attacker would have a direct match of Shop -> ShopID, thus deanonymizing the private listing. \n\nI believe it's fair to assume that if a Shop is being sold on the Marketplace it will have a decent amount of traffic. Thus, it should definitely be present in any of these available datasets.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can deanonymize private listings in Marketplace, finding out who the Shop Owner/Seller is and what is the business.",
