  "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:**\nAn attacker is able to upload files of any type to `███SubmitRequest/Index.cfm?fwa=wizardform` as long as they are less than 5 MB.\n\n**Description:**\nThe █████ ████ Request System allows a user to submit requests to the ██████████ ███ for event support. An attacker can exploit this request form by uploading malicious files due to an unrestricted file upload feature.\n\n## Impact\nAn attacker is able to upload malicious files onto the server. These files are attached to a request for support from the ██████ █████████. If a member of the ██████ ████ were to open the malicious file, the attacker could gain remote code execution on ████ information systems. Alternatively, if the attacker finds out how to browse to the file, they could obtain a web shell on the target, giving them remote code execution.\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1. Browse to `██████PublicSite/index.cfm?fwa=newreq` and click on `Create a New Request`.\n██████████\n2. Fill in your e-mail address and click `Submit`.\n██████████\n3. Fill out the fields in the form.\n███\n████\n███\n███████\n4. Before submitting the request, click the `Upload Files` tab.\n█████\n5. This page will allow you to upload any file you wish as long as it is under 5MB in size. I tested by uploading an executable (visual studio community installer) and a php file. These files were deleted from my request after submitting this report.\n███████\n6. Once uploaded, you can submit your request. An attacker would need to submit this request in hopes of the █████ ████████ downloading the malicious attachment.\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nRestrict file uploads to safe extensions such as .jpg, .png, etc. to prevent an attacker from uploading malicious files onto the server.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker is able to upload malicious files onto the server. These files are attached to a request for support from the ████ ██████████. If a member of the ████ ██████████ were to open the malicious file, the attacker could gain remote code execution on ██████ information systems. Alternatively, if the attacker finds out how to browse to the file, they could obtain a web shell on the target, giving them remote code execution.",
