For the purposes of the further analysis of the vulnerability, that you kindly report to us, could you please fill *all* fields [in square brackets]. This information will help us to respond you more quickly and triage your report. Thanks a lot for your assistance.\n\nI use Translator, T_T Sorry\n\n**Summary**\ncan turn off anti-virus functionality in an external process.\n\n**Description**\nUse the SetWindowsHookEx function to inject the DLL. The ClientLoadLibrary was hooked to prevent injection, but dlls with specific file names were injectable(tiptsf.dll). After that, I was able to hook some WinAPIs and turn off antivirus.\n\n**Environment**\n- Scope: Application\n- Product name: Kaspersky Internet Security\n- Product version:20.0.14.1085\n- OS name and version (incl SP): Windows 10 RS5\n- Attack type: Bypass\n- Maximum user privileges needed to reproduce your issue: no privileges\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n1. FindWindow and get hwnd from kaspersky internet security(avpui.exe)\n2. I have invoked the SetWindowsHookEx function to inject the DLL.\n3. After hooking the TrackPopupMenu function, send a pop-up message through PostMessage.\n4. When self-protection is turned on, it generates a new avpui.exe and then generates a Dialog that asks users to confirm. the generated process also injects dll.\n5. In the newly created avpui.exe, hook the IsDialogMessageW function and switch to a message that occurs when you click the OK button.\n6. download ransomware & run.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe bypass function can be used to turn off the antivirus before the malware is activated.",
