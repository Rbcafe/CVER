  "vulnerability_information": "###Summary\nWhen sending too much data through file upload, the server returns an invalid 500 status code instead of the speed 429 status code, causing an internal denial of service.\n\n###Description\nI uploaded a file from the https://www.werkenbijbakertilly.nl/vacatures/solliciteer/senior-hr-consultant-317 page to test the speed limit, bypass, problem, and hit submit to start testing the speed limit did. As a result, while investigating the problem, we found an interesting bug. First, I found that if I send too many requests to the server, a slow response and an internal denial of service occur with 500 status codes instead of 429 status codes.\n\nI knew that this would result in a real denial of service, and I immediately stopped testing. In addition, we found that when denial of service is activated through the 502 status code, some information is exposed. A report on the release of this information was rewritten by #892610.\n\n###Environment\n- Browser : Chrome Version 83.0.4103.56 (official build) beta (64-bit)\n- Scope: Web Application\n- Attack type: Denial of Service\n- Maximum user privileges needed to reproduce your issue: no privileges\n- Domain : https://www.werkenbijbakertilly.nl/vacatures/solliciteer/senior-hr-consultant-317\n- Influence range : https://www.werkenbijbakertilly.nl\n\n###Proof of Concept\n██████\n\n###Steps To Reproduce :\n1. Go to the https://www.werkenbijbakertilly.nl/vacatures/solliciteer/senior-hr-consultant-317 Page.\n2. Basically I need to upload a cv file when uploading the file. This is a normal cv file. Please upload this file ██████\n3. Submit a form upload a file, and grap the packet.\n4. Now we need to send too many requests to activate the 500 code.\n5. Send a lot of data through Burp Suite -> Intruder function.\n6. Now, when the 500th code is activated, the internal service denial occurs through the 502 status code.\n\n###Recommendation\nIf you send too many requests, the server should not have code 500 activated. Reimplement to enable the 429 status code.\n\n## Impact\n\nInternal denial of service leads to total denial of service within the web service https://www.werkenbijbakertilly.nl.",

Due to integrations with an external service, the request had to wait for response of the third party server in order to return response to the applying visitor. Doing a lot of POSTs in a row caused a lot of waiting time due to curl waits. This caused the application to not respond in a timely manner\n\nThe fix was to implement a middleware which throttles requests when 'too many' requests are send. The 'too many' can be configured based on the needs of the application.\n",
