After further investigation, we also found that both applications had the same issue with their authentication functionality, due to using the same library. The issue was that old tokens were not expiring and being properly invalidated, allowing for replay attacks that should not have been possible.\n\nThe applications were highly sensitive in nature, but due to not being able to retrieve specific data, we decided to award a bounty slightly below the maximum reward for this type of issue. We want to thank @kazan71p  for his cooperation and contribution to our program!",
