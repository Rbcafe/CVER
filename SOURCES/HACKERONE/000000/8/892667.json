  "vulnerability_information": "#Summary:\nThe subdomain ██████ had an CNAME record pointing to an unclaimed ███████ webservice. This is a high severity security issue because an attacker can register the subdomain on ███ and therefore can own the subdomain  █████████.\n\n\n\n#Description:\nThe dangling CNAME record of █████████  is pointing to █████.███████ which was not claimed by you. I registered a service with this name and therefore was able to takeover the subdomain. Every attacker doing this has afterwards full control over the contents served on this subdomain.\n\n\n\n#Subdomain Affected: \n██████████\n\n\n\n\n#Proof Of Concept:\nI have uploaded a simple subdomain takeover PoC on http://███████/████████\n\n\n\n\n\n# Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n1. Open ██████ and register for web app which is under market place. I have used ██████  (See: ████)\n\n2. After registering, go to Custom Domains which will be available under settings. (See: ████)\n\n3. In here, add custom domain i have used █████████ (See: █████)\n\n4. After that upload any PoC you want to upload. I have used ████ which has my PoC. (See: ███████)\n\n\n\n\n\n#Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\n1. Remove the dangling CNAME record for █████\n\n2. Claim it back in ███████ portal after I release it\n\n#Reference\nSome hackerone reports #661751 #325336\n\n#NOTE:\nI have claimed the subdomain http://█████████ at the current moment to keep it safe from malicious users. Whenever you want i will release ██████.███. Afterwards you can claim it back.\n\n## Impact\n\nSubdomain takeover is abused for several purposes:\n\n1.\tMalware distribution\n2.\tPhishing / Spear phishing\n3.\tXSS",
