  "vulnerability_information": "Hi again!!\n\nBack in 2019, I had reported that a pulseSSL VPN server owned by US DoD can be compromised by a publicly available exploit. The report is #681249. As a result, the userid and passwd db was also compromised. I  found  that at least 1 userid and password combination from that compromised db can still be used. \n\n\n##PoC\n\nHere is a screenshot of me accessing a US DoD owned website using a compromised credentials found back in 2019. I am still able to login to https://████/dana-na/auth/url_46/welcome.cgi with:\n\nl: ███\np: █████████\n\n███████\n███████\n\nHere is the creds from  Sep, 2019.\n\n█████\n\n## Impact\n\nIt is widely reported in the media that blackhat hackers around the world are still hacking fully patched PulseSSL VPN hosts because owners did not change the passwords that was compromised back in 2019. The articles that I am referring  to is at :\n\nhttps://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-107a\nhttps://thehackernews.com/2020/04/pulse-secure-vpn-vulnerability.html\n\n##Fix\nOther than patching, it is strongly advisable that the impacted organization `███`   __reset all passwords immediately__.",
