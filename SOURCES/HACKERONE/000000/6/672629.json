Training databases often have elements of sensitive data left over from old production databases, so this may expose sensitive information.\n\n**Please note that I did not attempt to login using the credentials, as I didn't want to violate any terms of your policy.**\n\nIf you would like me to attempt to login to test this vulnerbility, please let me know. \n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\nUsing the google dork ``site:*.mil ext:ppt intext:password``, examine any results which appear to include usernames or passwords\n\nSee: ███\n\n## Impact\n\nAttackers may be able to access the contents of either system, which could include sensitive data.",
