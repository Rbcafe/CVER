  "vulnerability_information": "Hi Team,\n\n**Summary:**\n\nFirst of all, the issue that i have found have multiple steps, so please make sure to follow the steps accordingly.\n\nI was able to put my hacker name on private program hacktivity profile showing that i have report that was resolved, this will also reflect to my hacker profile.\n\n## Requirements:\n\n- The program should have a security forwarding feature\n- The hacker/researcher will use the hackerone publishing feature\n\nFor PoC purposes, I have tested it in [███████](https://hackerone.com/███████) private program because they have `security@` email forwarding: `hackerone@█████████.com`.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Assume that you are not invited to [███████](https://hackerone.com/██████████) private program private program, first step, use the publish feature, go here: https://hackerone.com/hacktivity/publish\n2. Submit a publish report, put ████████ (███████) in Program (see below), put any test details and hit `Publish Vulnerability`.\n████\n3. Now the vulnerability is under `Pending review` by a moderator\n4. Send a test mail to `hackerone@████.com` to get an invitation to submit a report, accept the invitation and you will become a participant of the said private program.\n5. After that you will observed after how many hours, it will show on the private program hacktivity page your publish report will show as `resolved` ███████ and displayed on their hacktivity timeline, this will also show on your hacker profile time line ███. \n\n## Additional PoC below:\n\n████\n\nThe report number of that publish report is https://hackerone.com/reports/652941 , __please note that this test publish report is still under pending review by the moderator.\n\n## Impact\n\nHacker can manipulate the private program hacktivity page to show his/her hackerone name to look like there is so many report that was submitted and resolved.\n\nThis will also manipulate the hacker profile to show that he/she have many report that was submitted and resolved to a particular private program.\n\nAudience for that hacker will be tricked.\n\nLet me know if you need additional information.\n\nRegards\nJapz",
