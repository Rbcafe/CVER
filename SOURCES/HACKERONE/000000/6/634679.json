  "vulnerability_information": "The Custom Field feature is currently only available for customers on the Enterprise product edition. A trial period can be given by enabling the `custom-fields-trial` feature for programs who are not on that product edition (yet). However, when enabling this feature, the incorrect ordering of an ACL causes a vulnerability that allows anyone that can access the program to create and update Custom Field Attributes. This also works for private programs with an External Program Profile.\n\n# Steps to reproduce\nBelow are two regression specs. Both of these specs currently fail on `develop` and `master`.\n\n```ruby\ndescribe '#can_manage_custom_fields?' do\n  # ... other specs for this ACL ...\n  subject { Pavlov.can? :manage_custom_fields, team, user }\n\n  let(:user) { create :user }\n\n  context 'with trial feature enabled' do\n    before { create :feature, teams: [team], key: Feature::CUSTOM_FIELDS_TRIAL }\n\n    context 'with a private program' do\n      let(:team) { create :team, :soft_launched }\n\n      context 'without a published external program' do\n        # adding `user` as an invited hacker to the team\n        before do\n          Commands::WhitelistedReporters::Create.interact \\\n            user: user,\n            team: team,\n            source: WhitelistedReporter::SOURCE_UNKNOWN_INVITE\n        end\n\n        it { is_expected.to eq false }\n      end\n\n      context 'with a published external program' do\n        before { create :external_program, team: team }\n\n        it { is_expected.to eq false }\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n# Root cause\nBelow is a copy of the `manage_custom_fields` ACL:\n\n```ruby\ndef can_manage_custom_fields?\n  return_true_if { feature_enabled?(::Feature::CUSTOM_FIELDS_TRIAL, team: team) }\n  return_false_if { team.gates.closed?(FeatureGating::Gates::CUSTOM_FIELDS) }\n  can_view_custom_fields_settings?\nend\n\ndef can_view_custom_fields_settings?\n  return_true_if { program_management_permission? }\nend\n```\n\nThe first `return_true_if` block is called before the `program_management_permission?` block. Test coverage for this particular block was lacking in the integration specs for the ACL, as well as the classes using the ACL. This incorrect order was also missed during mandatory peer review.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis vulnerability enables arbitrary users to create and update existing Custom Field Attributes. This may disclose confidential attributes and its configuration set by program members or impact the integrity of an existing Custom Field Attribute. At this moment, only three programs have this feature enabled.",
