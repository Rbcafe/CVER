  "vulnerability_information": "> NOTE! Thanks for submitting a report! Please replace *all* the (parenthesized) sections below with the pertinent details. Remember, the more detail you provide, the easier it is for us to triage and respond quickly, so be sure to take your time filling out the report!\n\n### Summary\n\nThe site https://plantuml.pre.gitlab.com is vulnerable to SSRF. While I haven't spun up an instance to test if gitlab's integration with plantuml is vulnerable to this, it seems feasible that it is, given a few facotrs:\n#1 The SSRF is due to a feature in plantuml\n#2 A PlantUML integration exists for gitlab community edition\n#3 Due to conversation in gitlab (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/framework/issues/448, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/2163/) I believe this is a staging server for plantuml\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n(Step-by-step guide to reproduce the issue, including:)\n1. Visit the following link:\nhttps://plantuml.pre.gitlab.com/uml/Aov9B2hXKW02AvTyXUByt5I5ufBIj3Hhi9XYPbvoJcbAga96IKc1bRw-eP6vdW4G6bfP65WOS1MNv1TO0m00\n2. Note that the UML of the website is included\n\nNote: It seems that while I was testing, access to instance metadata (169.254.169.254) was blocked (or limited), as the server now returns an error after timing out for the following uml, where previously it returned information:\n```\n@startuml\nstart\n    :Do some stuff;\n    !include http://169.254.169.254/\nstop;\n@enduml\n```\n\n\n### Impact\nThis allows attackers to access internal endpoints and data. Additionally, had the instance metadata not been restricted, accessing that information would be feasible. Additionally, this will likely allow for bypassing of the block of /proxy mentioned in this issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/framework/issues/457\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nThe plantuml server returns data from internal addresses:\nhttps://plantuml.pre.gitlab.com/png/Aov9B2hXKW02AvTyXUByt5I5ufBIj3Hhi9XYPbvoJcbAga96IKc1bRw-eP6vdW4G6bfP65WOw7CLb-GNM0C0\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\nThe plantuml server does not allow link-local network includes via the `include` statement\n\n## Impact\n\nIt's difficult to say, but given the default plantuml installation allows for this SSRF, it's likely multiple on-premises installations would open a risk for SSRF once plantuml is enabled. This site also allows for accessing other resources on its network in its current state",

While this was not technically in scope, gitlab.com relies on network configuration to mitigate the SSRF risk plantuml presents via the `!include` function(which allows including remote resources). However, their standard setup instructions did not make it clear that this was a risk, and it is unlikely users configuring self-hosted gitlab instances would know to restrict network access to their PlantUML instance.",
