  "vulnerability_information": "user0 creates folders /test and /test/sub\nuser0 creates file /test/sub/file.txt\nuser0 shares folder /test with user1 with read+share permissions (17)\nuser1 receives the folder /test and can read-download /test/sub/file.txt - good\nuser1 creates a link share of /test/sub - it has permissions 1 (read-only) - good\nuser1 uses the sharing API to escalate the permissions of the link share, e.g.\n```\ncurl --user user1:user1 \"http://172.17.0.1:8081/ocs/v1.php/apps/files_sharing/api/v1/shares/3\" -H \"OCS-APIRequest: true\"  -X PUT --data 'permissions=15'\n```\nNow browse to the link, e.g. my link was http://172.17.0.1:8081/index.php/s/t9dfm6K57yo6a9r\n\nFrom the link, anyone (in this case user1, who has knowledge of the link) can create/change/delete files.\ne.g. delete file.txt and then upload other files, or some different file.txt\n\nNow login as user0. \n\nuser0 sees that the content of /test/sub has been changed. But they only gave read and share permissions to user1. They never gave any create-change-delete permissions to anyone.\n\n## Impact\n\nA user who has shared some folder(s) read-only can have the content of sub-folders modified by a user who has received the read-only share.\n\nHere is a realistic use case where this public link share permissions bump will be a real issue:\n\n1) the organisation shares read-only a folder to almost everybody. In that folder are sub-folders that have files that have, for example, organisation policy documents (`Policy/Finance` `Policy/HR` etc folders)\n2) just 1 user `bob`'s password/authentication details are compromised, or `bob` is malicious himself\n3) the attacker `bob` makes a read-only public link share of each sub-folder\n4) the attacker `bob` increases the permissions of the public link share to read-write-delete\n5) the attacker `bob` browses to the public link share, deletes all the real policy documents and uploads different ones...\n\nNow everybody else in the organisation sees different documents in the (supposedly) read-only share.",
