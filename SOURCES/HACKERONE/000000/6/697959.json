If a user renames an unauthorized file to an allowed file, he can upload and download it. The MIME type of the current file is insignificant, only the file extension is checked. \n\nA company administrator prohibits the upload of exe files using file access control and MIME types. One user \ncopies his remote access application as a txt file to Nextcloud and downloads it in his professional environment.\n\nA user on github has created a patch that has not yet found its way into the public repository.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker could upload malicious files that have been blocked by the administrator.",
