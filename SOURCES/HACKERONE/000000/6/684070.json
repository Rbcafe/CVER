  "vulnerability_information": "##Description\nHello. I was able to identify Cisco TelePresence SX80 device located on the https://█████\nAccording to the IP Info: https://ipinfo.io/████████it belongs to ASN with ID \n```\n███████\n```\nso it's likely in scope of the program.\nThe mentioned instance has default credentials `████`\n\n##POC\nhttps://███████\nLogin with `█████████`\n████\nSince we are logged in as ███, we can completely control the device and all connections, and add our startup scripts via https://██████████/web/scripts\n\n##Suggested fix\nChange the credentials and likely you will need to reset the device\n\n## Impact\n\nPotential device compromise and code execution. This devices are used mainly for trainings, briefings, and demonstration rooms, as well as auditoriums, so attacker with full control of the device potentially can intercept the data (RCE potential is interesting, but ability to silently compromise the device and use it as backdoor can be much more harmful).",
