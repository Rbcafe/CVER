  "vulnerability_information": "##Description + Attacking approach\n\n**API Workflow** :\n\n- The MoPub Reporting API supports two separate CSV outputs where publishers can retrieve inventory or campaign performance data.\n\n- Publishers can retrieve daily reports via making a GET request using the request parameters.\n\n- This URL will return a 302 redirect response. The link to download the report will be returned in the response location header.\n\n-----\n\n**How you grab Report data even after company removed you**\n\n- If Publisher/Company invite you for their MoPub Account with any permissions & Roles.\n (\"administrators or Members\" - it doesn't matter, which permission company gives you while invitation)\n\n- After accept the invitation you have access to make all changes to the company account. \n\n-----\n\n**Attacking approach start from here**\n\n- In order to retrieve data, the API must first be enabled for company account.\n- So, you can Enable data access through API (just click on checkbox in the Reports page of the MoPub UI.)\nor it might be already enabled by publisher.\n- Note down the \"Reporting API access details\". [i.e. API key, Inventory report ID, Campaign report ID]\n- Also Note the Report ID of each MoPub Report present inside the Company Account.\n\n**!!!**\n\n- Now, the publisher/company doesn't want you with their MoPub account and they removed you from their Manage User settings.\n- But they forgot to Reset API key.\n- Now, you don't have any access of company account. \n\n> NOTE! **You have the \"Reporting API access details (which you noted)\".**\n\n-----\n\n**Access the Reporting API :**\n\n- GET request using the request parameters.\n\n[report_key=[individual_report_id ; inventory_report_id ; campaign_report_id]\napi_key=[API_KEY]\ndate=Date of the report. Format YYYY-MM-DD]\nhttps://app.mopub.com/reports/custom/api/download_report?report_key=[REP_KEY]&api_key=[API_KEY]&date=[YYYY-MM-DD]\n\n- Sample Request:\n\n██████████\n\n-----\n\n##Remediation :\n\n1. API key must be auto-reset after the user removed from company.\n2. **(for 2nd condition in impact)** Once the Data access is disabled, user should not be able to access reports data via API.\n\n\n.\n\n\n**Thank you : )**\n\n## Impact\n\n- Attacker(removed user) able to access Organization Current as well as in Future created MoPub reports in 2 conditions :\n\n1. If API key is not reset and \"data access through API\" checkbox is enabled \n2. If API key is not reset and \"data access through API\" checkbox is disabled.",
