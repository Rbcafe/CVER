  "vulnerability_information": "Assigned to:-ED\nAssigned by:- Kirtikumar Anandrao Ramchandani\nAssigned on:- 01/05/2018\nBug overview:- Session Cookie without secure flag.\nCookie Name:- _gitlab_session\nDescription:-Risk description:\nSince the Secure flag is not set on the cookie, the browser will send it over an unencrypted channel (plain HTTP) if such a request is made. Thus, the risk exists that an attacker will intercept the clear-text communication between the browser and the server and he will steal the cookie of the user. If this is a session cookie, the attacker could gain unauthorized access to the victim's web session. \nRecommendation:I recommend reconfiguring the web server in order to set the flag(s) Secure to all sensitive cookies. \nReference:-https://blog.dareboost.com/en/2016/12/secure-cookies-secure-httponly-flags/.\n\nImpact\nThe secure flag is an option that can be set by the application server when sending a new cookie to the user within an HTTP Response. The purpose of the secure flag is to prevent cookies from being observed by unauthorized parties due to the transmission of a the cookie in clear text.\nTo accomplish this goal, browsers which support the secure flag will only send cookies with the secure flag when the request is going to a HTTPS page. Said in another way, the browser will not send a cookie with the secure flag set over an unencrypted HTTP request.\nBy setting the secure flag, the browser will prevent the transmission of a cookie over an unencrypted channel.\nThank you very much sir :) whatever you can award it will be a great honour for me to secure your website at just age of 15. Once again thank you very much and have a tip: I had learned we should never apologlize if we have learned any lesson. Have a great day and have a great day,\n\nKind regards,\nKirti\n\n## Impact\n\nThe secure flag is an option that can be set by the application server when sending a new cookie to the user within an HTTP Response.
