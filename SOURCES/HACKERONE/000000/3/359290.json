  "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:**\nAn LDAP Injection has been found at the mentioned domain\n\n**Description:**\nWhile performing a user registration, is it possible to edit the request and inject invalid characters, resulting in a LDAP injection\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n1. Visit page https://█████████/Registration/Home/New\n2. Start a new registration process with \"regular\" data\n3. The request is correctly processes  \n4. Start a new registration process and use a double quote as first name\n5. You will get a fatal error\n\nAttached you can find the rogue request and the screenshot of the fatal error.  \nError `0x80005000` is specific of LDAP, this means that the application is trying to handle user data without sanitizing it\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nApplication should sanitize **all** user input before trying to store it in any way.\n\n## Impact\n\nAttacker could enumerate current domain or exfiltrate data.  \nOn more practical terms, since user should be manually validated, attacker could bypass such activation.\nThat's a serious threat, because all requests must be approved and verified by other US Officers.",
