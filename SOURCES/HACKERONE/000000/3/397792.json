  "vulnerability_information": "Hola amigos,\n\nFirst off, I know RFCs are annoying.\nSecond of all, namespace attacks are a b*tch.\n\nWith that out of the way, here is an Inti-bug that was discovered as a result of reading RFC2142 very carefully.\n\n## Brief summary of RFC2142\n\nRFC2142 defines a standard set of email addresses that cover certain roles and functions. For example, you might be familiar with the `security@` address. This was originally defined in section 4 of RFC2142: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2142#section-4.\n\n```\nMAILBOX        AREA                USAGE\n-----------    ----------------    ---------------------------\nABUSE          Customer Relations  Inappropriate public behaviour\nNOC            Network Operations  Network infrastructure\nSECURITY       Network Security    Security bulletins or queries\n```\n\n## Ze Bug\n\nThe way the new `@wearehackerone.com` email forwarding system works, is that an address is allocated for your HackerOne account based on your username (`<your-h1-handle>@wearehackerone.com`). So hackerone.com/foobar turns into `foobar@wearehackerone.com`. With this in mind, I decided to enumerate all the various email addresses defined in RFC2142 and determine which ones can be registered ultimately resulting in me controlling what should be a reserved email address.\n\nIn some cases you do actually prevent people from claiming the handle, such as with `postmaster`.\n\n███\n\nUnfortunately though, after a bit of probing I noticed that not all RFC2142 addresses were blocked. I am now the proud owner of trouble@wearehackerone.com. Please feel free to shoot me an email and I will respond back to demonstrate that this address is under my control.\n\n## How to fix this issue\n\nIn order to fix this issue, I advise you to add the following usernames to your exclusion list so that one cannot hijack these important email addresses.\n\n```\nabuse\nadmin\nadministrator\nhostmaster\ninfo\nis\nit\nlist\nlist-request\nmajordomo\nmarketing\nmis\nnews\npostmaster\nroot\nsales\nsecurity\nssl-admin\nssladmin\nssladministrator\nsslwebmaster\nsupport\nsysadmin\ntrouble\nusenet\nuucp\nwebmaster\n```\n\nHave fun fixing this issue and feel free to email me at trouble@wearehackerone.com if you are having any trouble reproducing this issue. ;)\n\n\\- @thefrog\n\n## Impact\n\nIn some cases, these reserved addresses are used to generate SSL certificates since CAs assume that these are all trusted addresses.",
