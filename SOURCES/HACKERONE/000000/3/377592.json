  "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:**\nA Monero bug (already fixed in master) allows theft from exchanges.  This has been exploited again a Monero-derived coin, so the exploit may be underway currently.\n\n**Description:**\n(fluffypony: Also please mention you spoke to me and I recommended you put it on HackerOne)\n\nPR #3985 fixed a wallet balance display bug, which seems innocuous enough, but this bug also extends to exchanges: a transfer of, e.g., 1 XMR to an exchange with a duplicated TX pub key will show up on an exchange as a 2 XMR deposit, which then allows the attacker to withdraw 2 XMR from the exchange's wallet.  An attacker could exploit this repeatedly to siphon of all of the exchange's balance.\n\n## Releases Affected:\n\n  * 0.12.2.0, which is currently active and used by exchanges, and likely earlier releases.\n  * current master and the 0.12.3.0 PR branch have the fix applied\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. deliberately double-sign a transaction with the tx pub key, e.g. by doubling the `add_tx_pub_key_to_extra(tx, txkey_pub);` call in `src/cryptonote_core/cryptonote_tx_utils.cpp`.\n  1. Transfer an amount (or send to an exchange)\n  1. See 2x the transferred amount appear on the recipient wallet (or the exchange).\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n  * I've notified several other Monero-derived coins that I am in contact with, along with Cryptopia.\n  * This attack was carried out against ArQmA on altex.exchange; 4 different wallets managed to steal the entire ARQ exchange deposits before the ARQ wallet was put into maintenance.\n\n## Impact\n\nTheft of all coins deposited in an exchange wallet.",
