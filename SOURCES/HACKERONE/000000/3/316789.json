  "vulnerability_information": "**Description**\nThere is a vulnerability in card.starbucks.com.sg that allows an attacker to modify the purchasing value of a starbucks gift card such that he is paying the minimum amount for the maximum value of the gift card.\n\n**Attack Summary**\nAn attacker is able to pay $0.01 for a $100 gift card and gift the card to himself thus allowing him to use the card.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\n1)Visit https://card.starbucks.com.sg/egift/cards.php?cat=Singapore%20Exclusive\n2)Fill in the relevant values, set the emails to your starbucks account email and the input value to $300 at the start\n3)Use a web proxy to monitor the web traffic and click on the check out button.\n4)Change the original values of the request from \ntxtAmount=300&amount=300&txtCustomAmount=300 to txtAmount=0.1&amount=0.1&txtCustomAmount=0.1 and submit the request\n5)An encoded string of the value 0.1 will be displayed in the following request as vpc_Amount=XcfYhTj%2BHFIY5c9n8sSCzqDFAxXGgXXoZgF0VVUBvjM%3D, where =XcfYhTj%2BHFIY5c9n8sSCzqDFAxXGgXXoZgF0VVUBvjM%3D is the value 0.1\n5)Copy that string and drop the entire request\n7)Repeat step 1 to 4, this time change ONLY the value in the variable \"amount\" so the request would look like this:\ntxtAmount=300&amount=300&txtCustomAmount=300 to txtAmount=300&amount=0.1&txtCustomAmount=300\n8)Proceed to click on the check out button and you will be brought from https://card.starbucks.com.sg/egift/checkout.php to https://card.starbucks.com.sg/egift/payment.php where the vpc_Amount is showed in the request. Change the original vpc_Amount value to the copied string XcfYhTj%2BHFIY5c9n8sSCzqDFAxXGgXXoZgF0VVUBvjM%3D\n9)Proceed on to submit the request and you will be brought over to the payment page by either visa/mastercard\n10)Continue payment as per usual and you will be paying $0.1 for a $300 starbucks card.\n11)Since the recipient email is the attacker's email he checks his email to redeem the card and adds it into his starbucks account.\n12)The attacker now has a $300 starbucks gift card that he only paid $0.1 for.\n\n## Impact\n\nBy abusing this function, an attacker could gain unlimited values for his starbucks card.",
