  "vulnerability_information": "I recently found an abandoned and/or overlooked nodejs.org subdomain that was indirectly pointing to Fastly. Fastly doesn't require any proof of DNS ownership to register new distributions that use a given domain, so I was able to effectively take it over.\n\nVulnerability: Subdomain Takeover via Fastly\nHost: http://registry.nodejs.org\n\nSolution:\nThere are two possible solutions to remediate this issue:\n\n1.) If you no longer wish to use registry.nodejs.org, you can simply delete the registry.nodejs.org CNAME record that is currently pointing to registry.npmjs.org.\n\n2.) Alternatively, if you would like to continue using and/or supporting registry.nodejs.org, you can coordinate with me, I will delete my Fastly service so that someone from nodejs.org can add the registry.nodejs.org domain to the \"Domains\" field in the related Fastly service.  This should be done in a timely and coordinated fashion to prevent another researcher (or less savory type) from registering it before you are able to.\n\n## Impact\n\nSince discovering this vulnerability I have received more than 300 requests for various npm packages. A malicious attacker could have used this access to begin delivering backdoored (or otherwise malicious) packages to users who were not using the correct registry setting of registry.npmjs.org.",
