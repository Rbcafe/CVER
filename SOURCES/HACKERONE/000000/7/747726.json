  "vulnerability_information": "Assume user have set **\"App passcode\"** to **\"Passcode/Device credentials\"**. So whenever user opens the app, it will prompt to unlock before accessing the app. Unfortunately there is a issue, attacker can able to bypass the lock easily in **two ways**.\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Install NextCloud app and Log in.\n2. Go to Settings and set \"App passcode\" to \"Passcode/Device credentials\".\n\n## How to bypass?\n\n- Bypassing the lock using ADB\n\n**Reproduce steps**\n\n1.Execute the below command in command Prompt.\n\n```\nadb shell am start com.nextcloud.client/com.owncloud.android.ui.activity.FileDisplayActivity\n```\n\n2.It will open the app and prompt to unlock, now don't close the app and execute the below command.\n\n```\nadb shell am start -a android.intent.action.SEARCH com.nextcloud.client/com.owncloud.android.ui.activity.FileDisplayActivity\n```\n\nNow it will open the app again, but this time **it will not prompt to unlock** (You can able to use the app without unlocking).\n\n- Bypassing the lock by changing device time\n\nBy default the app lock timeout is 5 seconds, so when the user close and reopens the app within 5 seconds, it will not prompt to unlock. \n\nSource code - https://github.com/nextcloud/android/blob/master/src/main/java/com/owncloud/android/authentication/PassCodeManager.java\n\n```java\n   private boolean passCodeShouldBeRequested(Long timestamp) {\n        return (System.currentTimeMillis() - timestamp) > PASS_CODE_TIMEOUT &&\n            visibleActivitiesCounter <= 0 && isPassCodeEnabled();\n    }\n```\n\nIn the above code, it checks whether user opened the app within 5 seconds or not by comparing the `current timestamp` and `app closed timestamp`. So attacker (Who knows the app closed time) can bypass this lock easily by changing the device time to app closed time.\n\n**Reproduce steps**\n\n1. Open the app and unlock.\n2. Close the app and note the app closed time (For instance, it is 10:00 AM).\n3. After 5 seconds or later (For instance, at 11:00 AM), open the app, it will prompt to unlock.\n4. Now change the device time to app closed time (For instance, 10:00 AM).\n5. Now open the app, it will not prompt to unlock.\n\n**Fix**\n\nDon't Use `System.currentTimeMillis()`, use `SystemClock.elapsedRealTime()` (Now attacker can't able to bypass the lock even if the app closed time is known). Refer http://sangsoonam.github.io/2017/03/01/do-not-use-curenttimemillis-for-time-interval.html\n\n**Tested envirnoment**\n\nApp version: 3.9.0\nAndroid version(s): 6.0, 8.1\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can easily access the victim Nextcloud app without unlocking \"Passcode/Device credentials\" lock.",
