Now I use https://cloud.domain.com/apps/gallery/s/randompath and see everything that gallery can display. In my case, it was an upload folder for pictures, so everything is displayed (and can be downloaded, even if I set \"hide download\"!).\n\n## Impact\n\nAccess all media files uploaded to a (not so secure) file-drop (https://nextcloud.com/file-drop/) folder.
