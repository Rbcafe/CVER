If the user viewing the reference to the file has permission to access the file, it will be rendered. Otherwise, the reference will be displayed as text.\n\nIf a user references a file from a private location in a public location, the file permissions will silently be updated and the file will be made available publicly as well (if the user has permission to access the file; otherwise, permissions will remain unchanged).\n\nThis behavior results in problems when a higher-privileged user edits the post of a lower-privileged user which contains a reference to a private file. The file will be disclosed publicly, without the user intending this or being aware of it.\n\nPOC\n---\n\nSetup:\n\n- Create a private task (task is just one example, all components are affected by this): `/maniphest/` -> create task -> Visible to / Editable by: administrators (or some other high-privileged group).\n- Add an attachment: leave a comment -> Upload file. Note the file ID.\n\nAttack:\n\n- With a lower-privileged user, create a public task (or some other component): `/maniphest/` -> create task -> Include a reference to the private file in the description, eg `{F27}`. Include some formatting mistakes, typos, profanity, etc to entice a higher-privileged user into editing the post.\n- Wait for a higher-privileged user viewing the task. The user will see the file attachment resolve normally, edit the task and fix the formatting error. Nothing will indicate that a private file has been made public.\n- After the user has edited the post, the file will be available to the lower-privileged user.\n\n## Impact\n\ndisclosure of private file attachments when a user with access to the attachment edits a post of a user without access to it.",
