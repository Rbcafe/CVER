  "vulnerability_information": "Hi,\n\n## Description\nI'm not exactly sure what happened, but it seems that my researcher email (jr0ch17@wearehackerone.com) has been added in a group that receives new user access request from [MIDRP](████████).\n████████\n██████████\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Steps to reproduce\nI'm honestly not sure what happened. I did test a few *.███ applications last week but haven't had the time to look at it since. However, I do believe I did attempt to register an account just to test the endpoint but I'm quite certain I wasn't granted access to anything as I haven't received any further email about that request. That said, I really have no clue how to reproduce this but I figured it would be best if I let you guys know about it.\n&nbsp;\n\n## Impact\n\nThis \"bug\" is currently disclosing me users' organization, phone number and email address which in some way could be considered PII. However, I'm not sure if this information is really sensitive for you guys.\n\nLet me know if you have any question or require more information.\n\nThanks,\nJR0ch17",
