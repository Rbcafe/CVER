  "vulnerability_information": "Hi Team,\n\n## Summary,\nWhen my free trial subscription was activated on wakatime.com, i also found that there is a new tab or features which is the `Teams`, \nIn `Teams` you can manipulate again others `fullname` without their knowledge.\nas the details of my other reports [[Privilege Escalation] Authenticated users can manipulate others fullname without their knowledge\n](https://hackerone.com/reports/244567) This time the endpoint that we are using is Teams, not Leaderboards.\n\n## Steps:\n1.) Go to the Teams->Settings->Members\n2.) Invite other users on your Teams member settings\n3.) Now you will see again that there is `Edit Icon` on the victim after fullname, Click that.\n4.) Then prompt will pop up saying \"Enter new name for blahblah..\" then just put a value e.g. HACKED AGAIN!\n5.) Now go login the victim email, and you will notice that the fullname of the victim was change into HACKED AGAIN!\n\n## Here is the PoC Video for clearer demonstration.\n{F200597}\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\n\nDon't allow other authenticated users to manipulate others fullname.\n\nKind Regards,\n@reydd",
