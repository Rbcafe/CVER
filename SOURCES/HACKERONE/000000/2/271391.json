  "vulnerability_information": "Hi,\n\nApologies for the weakness label, it was the closest I could find for what appears to be a server misconfiguration.\n\nTypically, in MVC frameworks like Slim (which I see you are using here), Symfony, Laravel, etc., the front controller is the only thing exposed, leaving `vendor/`, `logs/`, and others outside of document root, inaccessible to web browsers.\n\nHowever, it appears that here that's not the case, having `vendor/` accessible.\n\n## PoC\n\n`https://www.zomato.com/vendor/composer/installed.json`\n\n`https://www.zomato.com/vendor/slim/slim/composer.json`\n\n`https://www.zomato.com/vendor/bin/phpunit`\n\nI can see that Slim is used, and various libraries are installed with `composer`.\n\n\n## Why it's a concern\n\nRecently, `phpunit` had an RCE vulnerability, that if exposed, would allow users to run arbitrary PHP code. PHPUnit is indeed installed: `https://www.zomato.com/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php`. However, it appears that you are fortunately running the patched version. Reference: `http://phpunit.vulnbusters.com/`.\n\n\n## Additional notes\n\nI did try other directories, like the `logs/` directory, but it doesn't seem to be exposed. Or at least the common `app.log` isn't available.",
