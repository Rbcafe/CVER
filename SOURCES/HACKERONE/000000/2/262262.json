After he had recovered his account he removed Mixmax from Connected apps so that no one would then be able to access his mixmax account but the attacker who is already signed in will not get signed out and can do harmful damage to the user's Mixmax account.\n\nIf you need any other information plz be free to ask.\n\nRegards,\nAli Ashber",
