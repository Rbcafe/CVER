  "vulnerability_information": "Hello,\n\nI would like to report a vulnerability on https://micropurchase.18f.gov where I am able to reuse session cookie of a test user account i accessed through Github.\nThe problem is that the cookies stored on the browser are not getting expired after logging out from the platform and from Github as well.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. visit https://micropurchase.18f.gov\n2. click on sign in through Github\n3. Once you are logged in Then Use \"BurpSuite\" or any other Utility to get the cookies of that session (  \"EditThisCookie\" Chrome Extension can be used and in a Case of an  Attacker he can Use Any Sort Of cookie Stealing Script or Cookies Spoofing Utility to get his hands on cookies ) and grab the cookies of active User Session.\n4.Then Logout of the Account from https://micropurchase.18f.gov .\n5. Clear all Cookies related to https://micropurchase.18f.gov using [cookies manager+ extension]Then Inject Hijacked User Cookies so that you can get into the user session...\n6. After the cookies been injected You will See That the main page showing account and logout parameters on the front end.\n\nAttack Scenario :--  If The Attacker Got his Hands Upon Users Cookies he can Get Access To the User Account.An attacker can get the user session cookies by any means Session Spoofer, Cookie Stealer etc.As the user cookies are not expiring so an attacker can directly inject the stolen cookies of a victim in a request from browser and thus can have access to the victims account.\n\nSo expire the cookies once a user is logged out of the website.\nPOC:- I am providing a video poc :- https://youtu.be/uLFJUJ3CnQQ , its unlisted video.\n\nRegards\nsahil tikoo\n\n",
