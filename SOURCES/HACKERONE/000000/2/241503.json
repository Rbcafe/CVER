While we were still securely serving content from this domain and it did not impact users or operations, it would have been possible for @benoculars to serve content from unique URLs not in use by our apps & services.\n\nIn the past, others have reported that they suspected this to be vulnerable for subdomain takeover but no one had provided evidence.  Similarly, we initially closed this report, considering it a false positive.  \n\n@benoculars then went one step further to provide a non-destructive PoC demonstrating his ability to serve content from our domain. Based on the PoC & repro steps provided, a flaw was identified in the approval process which required human interaction.  This was unique in that, given the root cause, it may not have always resulted in a successful takeover.\nTo resolve the issue, operational and platform code changes were introduced.\n\nThanks @benoculars for going the extra step to create that PoC & answer our questions about repro steps.  Nice work!",
