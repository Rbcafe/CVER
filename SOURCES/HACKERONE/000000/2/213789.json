  "vulnerability_information": "The php-saml library as used by our SSO implementation had a minor security patch in 2.10.4 as per https://github.com/onelogin/php-saml/commit/949359f5cad5e1d085c4e5447d9aa8f49a6e82a1.  So we should update this in our next minor releases.\n\n> Security update for signature validation on LogoutRequest/LogoutResponse.\n>\n> In order to verify Signatures on Logoutrequests and LogoutResponses we use\n> the verifySignature of the class XMLSecurityKey from the xmlseclibs library.\n> That method end up calling openssl_verify() depending on the signature algorithm used.\n> \n> The openssl_verify() function returns 1 when the signature was successfully verified,\n> 0 if it failed to verify with the given key, and -1 in case an error occurs.\n> PHP allows translating numerical values to boolean implicitly, with the following correspondences:\n> - 0 equals false.\n> - Non-zero equals true.\n> \n> This means that an implicit conversion to boolean of the values returned by openssl_verify()\n> will convert an error state, signaled by the value -1, to a successful verification of the\n> signature (represented by the boolean true).\n> \n> The LogoutRequest/LogoutResponse signature validator was performing an implicit conversion > to boolean\n> of the values returned by the verify() method, which subsequently will return the same output\n> as openssl_verify() under most circumstances.\n> This means an error during signature verification is treated as a successful verification by the  method.\n>\n> Since the signature validation of SAMLResponses were not affected, the impact of this security\nvulnerability is lower, but an update of the php-saml toolkit is recommended.",
