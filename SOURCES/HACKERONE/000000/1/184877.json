  "vulnerability_information": "URL  https://████████/  \nIdentified Version  2.2.15 (contains 4 important and 10 other vulnerabilities)  \nLatest Version  2.2.31  \nVulnerability Database  Result is based on 27.10.2016 vulnerability database content.  \nVulnerability Details\n\n\nLink identified you are using an out-of-date version of Apache.\n\nImpact\n\nSince this is an old version of the software, it may be vulnerable to attacks.\n\nRemedy\n\n\nPlease upgrade your installation of Apache to the latest stable version.\n\nRemedy References\n\n•Downloading the Apache HTTP Server\n\nKnown Vulnerabilities in this Version\n\n\nMedium Apache mod_cache and mod_dav Request Handling Denial of Service Vulnerability \n\nThe mod_cache and mod_dav modules in the Apache HTTP Server allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process crash) via a request that lacks a path. \n\nExternal References\n•CVE-2010-1452 \n\nLow Apache APR-util apr_brigade_split_line() Denial of Service Vulnerability \n\nMemory leak in the apr_brigade_split_line function in buckets/apr_brigade.c in the Apache Portable Runtime Utility library (aka APR-util), as used in the mod_reqtimeout module in the Apache HTTP Server and other software, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via unspecified vectors related to the destruction of an APR bucket. \n\nExternal References\n•CVE-2010-1623 \n\nMedium Apache APR apr_fnmatch() Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\nStack consumption vulnerability in the fnmatch implementation in apr_fnmatch.c in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library before 1.4.3 and the Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.18, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via *? sequences in the first argument, as demonstrated by attacks against mod_autoindex in httpd. \n\nExternal References\n•CVE-2011-0419\n\nExploit\n•http://www.securityfocus.com/data/vulnerabilities/exploits/47820.txt\n\nMedium Apache HTTP Server CVE-2011-3192 Denial Of Service Vulnerability\n\nThe byterange filter in the Apache HTTP Server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a Range header that expresses multiple overlapping ranges, as exploited in the wild in August 2011, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-0086.\n\nExternal References\n•CVE-2011-3192\n\nExploit\n•http://www.securityfocus.com//data/vulnerabilities/exploits/49303.c\n• http://www.securityfocus.com/data/vulnerabilities/exploits/49303-2.c\n\nImportant Apache HTTP Server 'mod_proxy' Reverse Proxy Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\nThe mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server does not properly interact with use of (1) RewriteRule and (2) ProxyPassMatch pattern matches for configuration of a reverse proxy, which allows remote attackers to send requests to intranet servers via a malformed URI containing an initial @ (at sign) character.\n\nExternal References\n•CVE-2011-3368\n\nExploit\n•http://www.securityfocus.com//data/vulnerabilities/exploits/49957.py\n\nImportant Apache HTTP Server Scoreboard Local Security Bypass Vulnerability\n\nscoreboard.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.21 and earlier might allow local users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash during shutdown) or possibly have unspecified other impact by modifying a certain type field within a scoreboard shared memory segment, leading to an invalid call to the free function.\n\nExternal References\n•CVE-2012-0031\n\nImportant Apache HTTP Server 'mod_proxy' Reverse Proxy Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\nThe mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 1.3.x through 1.3.42, 2.0.x through 2.0.64, and 2.2.x through 2.2.21, when the Revision 1179239 patch is in place, does not properly interact with use of (1) RewriteRule and (2) ProxyPassMatch pattern matches for configuration of a reverse proxy, which allows remote attackers to send requests to intranet servers via a malformed URI containing an @ (at sign) character and a : (colon) character in invalid positions. \n\nExternal References\n•CVE-2011-4317\n\nImportant Apache HTTP Server CVE-2011-3348 Denial Of Service Vulnerability\n\nThe mod_proxy_ajp module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.21, when used with mod_proxy_balancer in certain configurations, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (temporary \"error state\" in the backend server) via a malformed HTTP request.\n\nExternal References\n•CVE-2011-3348\n\nMedium mod_proxy_ajp DoS Vulnerability\n\nThe mod_proxy_ajp module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.12 through 2.2.21 places a worker node into an error state upon detection of a long request-processing time, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (worker consumption) via an expensive request.\n\nExternal References\n•CVE-2012-4557\n\nLow Apache Multiple XSS Vulnerability\n\nMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the balancer_handler function in the manager interface in mod_proxy_balancer.c in the mod_proxy_balancer module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.24-dev and 2.4.x before 2.4.4 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted string.\n\nExternal References\n•CVE-2012-4558\n\nLow Apache Code Execution Vulnerability\n\nmod_rewrite.c in the mod_rewrite module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.25 writes data to a log file without sanitizing non-printable characters, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via an HTTP request containing an escape sequence for a terminal emulator.\n\nExternal References\n•CVE-2013-1862\n\nLow Apache Denial of Service Vulnerabillity\n\nmod_dav.c in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.25 does not properly determine whether DAV is enabled for a URI, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a MERGE request in which the URI is configured for handling by the mod_dav_svn module, but a certain href attribute in XML data refers to a non-DAV URI.\n\nExternal References\n•CVE-2013-1896\n\nLow Apache 'main/util.c' Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\nThe dav_xml_get_cdata function in main/util.c in the mod_dav module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.8 does not properly remove whitespace characters from CDATA sections, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted DAV WRITE request.\n\nExternal References\n•CVE-2013-6438\n\nLow Apache 'mod_log_config.c' Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\nThe log_cookie function in mod_log_config.c in the mod_log_config module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault and daemon crash) via a crafted cookie that is not properly handled during truncation.\n\nExternal References\n•CVE-2014-0098\n",
