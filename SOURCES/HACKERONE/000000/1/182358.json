This was an impressive find, and we want to give a huge shout-out to @faisalahmed for bringing this to our attention within 24 hours of releasing the new feature that contained this vulnerability!\n\nWhen a program has publicly disclosed a report on HackerOne, the platform supports the ability to perform a [limited disclosure](https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/articles/205269479). A normal disclosure includes vulnerability information, attachments, and the full timeline of activity. But a limited disclosure restricts visibility to a summary of the vulnerability and the timeline of activity (comments or actions).\n\nIn this particular case, the vulnerability allowed viewing the comments that would normally not be visible in a limited disclosure. Only comments were affected: the report's vulnerability information, attachments, and internal comments were not visible.\n\nHackerOne performed a thorough investigation of all uses of the export functionality and have found no evidence of malicious exploitation of this vulnerability. As part of our standard process, we have notified the programs affected by @faisalahmed and his colleague during the demonstration of the proof of concept to HackerOne.",
