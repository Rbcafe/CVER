  "vulnerability_information": "Hello\nWhen user upload file in comment to report, user can find file ID by two ways:\n1. In preview mode - In response to POST method `https://hackerone.com/attachments` , answer will be something like this:\n-`{\"id\":84577,\"name\":\"mytestfile.png\",\"size\":32397}` where file_ID = 84577 (for example)\n2. If user post comment - At link to hackerone-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com, where file_ID is part of the link \n.../production/000/084/579/2b912875c3e8856c300dad535b732500f3c42c25/...\nIn this case file_ID = 84579\n\nWhen user post new report to some company on page:\nhttps://hackerone.com/[some_company]/reports/new\nin this page user's draft autosave by POST request:\nhttps://hackerone.com/security/reports/draft_sync\n\nSo if user post comment to report_1 and get file_ID_1, then he go to post new report to another company\nand generate autosave POST request by himself and change file_ID_new_report to  file_ID_1\nFor example:\n`report%5Btitle%5D=&report%5Bvulnerability_information%5D=Ffile_ID_1&report%5Battachment_ids%5D%5B%5D= file_ID_1&report%5Bforce%5D=false`\nAnd, as you can see, set in param `vulnerability_information` Ffile_ID_1 (for example F84577)\n\nThen user reload page with new report (F5), there two issues:\n1. After Markdown parse he have direct link to file in comment (in our case file_ID_1 ): where comment to another report and another company.\nI think it's not so critical, but same experiment with file, which uploaded directly in initial report_1, is fail.\n2. More Strange - file_1 in comment to report_1 is deleted! No more link to file in this comment.\n\nMy same experiment with file uploaded by another user (I make test account : @dkusliy_test) also is fail.\nLuckily)) \n\nThanks and Best!",
