However, on the hotornot-images bucket, a (NoSuchKey) error is returned meaning we at least have access to read the bucket.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\nPete",

What is \"S3 bucket hotornot-images\"? What domain you accessing and how?*\n\n**Me:** *S3 bucket is Amazon's webservice for simple storage, it's like a file repository. I didn't access it through a website, using the Amazon command line tools, I found and accessed the bucket. When badoo acquired hotornot, did they have an aws account? By the sounds of it, you may be using Amazon services? If not, I'll close the ticket.*\n\n**Badoo:** *So you even didn't check do we use aws or not? Just reported? Don't you respect our time, @yaworsk?*\n\n**Report marked N/A**\n\nExplained what I did in two longer responses and said it would be my sole interaction with their site given the response.\n\n**Badoo:** *Lot of words but you still didn't even provide the domain name... [quoted my comment regarding sole interaction with them] -- Yes please, do us a favour.*\n\nThen I got an email saying I was banned from their program.",
