Create a doctors organization\n2. Create a staff member with no permissions\n3. Logout and log in as the staff member with no permissions\n4. Replicated the calls above substituting your cookies, CSRF, etc.\n\n##Vulnerability\nThis is another permission by pass. However, the most severe potential I see here is the ability for an attacker to modify a favorite which a doctor doesn't realize and then uses to prescribe to a patient.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\nPete",
