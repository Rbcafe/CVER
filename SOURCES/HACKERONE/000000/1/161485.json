The server responds with a 301 status code but redirects the visitors to the non-HTTPS site. It should respond with a 301 status code and the response header `Location` set to `https://www.lahitapiola.fi`.\n\nNon-secure connections need to be upgraded to HTTPS as soon as possible using a permanent redirect. Since this isn't happening, any information transmitted by users (including usernames and passwords) is at risk of compromise. Considering that the site responds to HTTPS requests @ `https://www.lahitapiola.fi` this oversight should be corrected.",

The report is somewhat related to #146707, where we fixed login-pages that served mixed content. \n\n##Fix\n\nSecure transport was enabled on www.lahitapiola.fi.\n\n##Reasoning\n\nThe issue was initially dismissed as not critical, as this site only presents public content and the login pages were already fixed. SSL/TLS misconfigurations are mostly treated as out of scope per our policy. Over time, the decision to start moving all content to https for this domains was made (for both security, trust and other reasons). As there was a report regarding this issue already present, we decided to award the reporter with a bounty. As a general policy, we are still quite strict on what SSL/TLS issues will be processed.",
