  "vulnerability_information": "Hey, this is Ahsan Tahir!\n\nIssue:\n---------\nWhen we try to signup with an email, it asks us for clicking a email validation link which is sent to our email, then we have to login, without clicking that link, we cannot login, but when we change email from user settings page/edit settings page, it doesn't asks us for validation..\n\nImpact:\n----------\nFor example, a user creates an account with his email (user@example.com) and verifies it using the link which has been sent to his email, as he/she have access to user@example.com, but next he goes  to settings and in email change mechanism, he can put any email like (president@whitehouse.gov) and no verification is required, and the user can login with that email and access his account with the email president@whitehouse.gov, and do some abusive or not good activities and the company will be blamed!\n\nSteps To Reproduce:-\n-------------------------\n1. Go to sign up form.\n2. Enter Any Email.\n3. Create account\n* The Account will be activated with any email verification!\n\nHow to fix?\n-------------------\nEmail verification/validation should be required when a user changed email from user settings page..\n\nI hope you'll fix it soon. :-)\n\nThanks,\nAhsan Tahir",
