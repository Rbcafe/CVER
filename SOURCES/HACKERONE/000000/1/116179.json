  "vulnerability_information": "Summary of Findings\n-------------------------------\n\nThe remote server (https://download.newrelic.com) allowed unauthenticated access to special access files that are only intended to be accessible after contacting the New Relic program managers as seen below.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/C4O4sln.png)\n\nExploiting the Vulnerability/Mis-configuration\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy performing search engine analysis, I was able to identify the name of a child directory `/eclipse-established` which appears to contain various source files related to special access/beta program application testing as seen below: \n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/fnfKjxz.png)\n\nConcluding Remarks/Remediation Advice\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nObviously there is a slight possibility that this was the intended function and that there was not supposed to be any type of access control over these directories - The reason that I may have identified this as a false positive is due to the fact that when a user tries to access the `/android_agent` directory they are provided with the instructions to contact support.\n\nIf this *is* the case and it is a mis-configuration, one option would be to enforce http basic authentication with something similar to the below example: \n\n    server {\n       listen 80;\n       server_name www.example.com example.com;\n       root /var/www/www.example.com/web;\n    [...]\n       location /eclipse-established {\n    auth_basic \"Restricted\";\n    auth_basic_user_file /var/www/www.example.com/.htpasswd;\n       }\n    [...]\n    }",
