  "vulnerability_information": "Hello,\n\nI just quickly took a glance, I am not entirely sure or didn't get a chance to test it but it seems there are some serious bugs.\n\nIn */apps/user_ldap/ajax/wizard.php*: \n```php\n36: $action = (string)$_POST['action']; \n```\nand it is called in multiple places. including line 83 & 99. one being `$action($loginName);` & since \n`$loginName` is defined as:\n\n```php\n$loginName = $_POST['ldap_test_loginname'];\n```\nwould mean an RCE is achievable when $result is called\n```php\n$result = $wizard->$action($loginName);\n``` \n \nThis is because userinput is used as dynamic function name. ergo, arbitrary functions may be called.\n\nAll an attacker have to send is a POST request with action parameter containing a function name like action=eval&ldap_test_loginname=stufftoexecute\n\nThere is a very little chance the $wizard will stop this because arbritary wakeup & constract objects may be exploitable. like I said, I didn't get a chance to test this but seems fairly feasible. please think about it and let me know.\n\nThanks,\nP\n",
