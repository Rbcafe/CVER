  "vulnerability_information": "Hi,\n\nI really would appreciate if you are transparent with this or does not close the bug quickly as N/A or something similar because of being purely theoretical.\nI am assuming HackerOne runs an x86 System. and the INT_MAX is **2,147,483,648**. (I know this because https://hackerone.com/reports/2147483647 returns 404 but https://hackerone.com/reports/2147483649 returns Error)\n\nWhile https://hackerone.com/reports/-2147483645 returns 404\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/-2147483649 returns Error\n\nTo try this bug, I need to have a verified program. because I can't do that (not sandbox to manipulate rep), I am reporting to you about why I think this works.\n\n- Integers can be from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (~ Â± 2 billion)\n\nIn any programming language, there should be an INT MAX limit. long, short, double... there is. In short:\n```if(INT_MAX+1 > 0)``` is usually true. In your case:\n```if (int(-2147483648) > 0)``` should return **false** which may be a WTF! \n\n-2147483648 is actually an expression: a positive literal value 2147483648 with unary - operator in front of it. Value 2147483648 is apparently too large for the positive side of int range on your platform.\n\nIn short: 2147483647 + 1 is actually -2147483648 and vice versa. **when you pass the MAX in int, it will become negative. and when you pass the negative limit, the number will become posetive**\n\nI am sure by now you are seeing where I am going with this. when an attacker submits too much vulnerabilities and if all are closed by the program as Spam (-10rep) that will give the user a negative reputation. \n\nIf he manages to get enough Spam (can write a script to automate reporting and closing as Spam) he will eventually have enough negative points that pass the int limit and be considered positive.\n\nSo if an attacker manages to do -2147483648 (consider his reputation) - 10 (another report closed as spam) = Positive. *My numbers may not be accurate because of a number of factors* \n\nThis is the oldest trick in the hat while stealing money from banks and sometimes even referenced as Integer Overflow (dont confuse it with the popular c++ bug)\n\nAnyway, take a look and there is more you didnt patch this and I may be right, if so: horry! if not: well, it was a fun writing this.\n\nThanks,\nPaulos",
