  "vulnerability_information": "**Enter the support PIN from your test site:**\n 423088\n**Enter the name of your test site :**\n https://bugbounty5.brickftp.com\n**Enter the subdomain from your test site :**\n https://bugbounty5.brickftp.com\n\n----\n\n**Description**\n\nSuppose there are 2 `Folders` in the site\n\n`Test1`\n`Test2`\n\nbut a member has only `Admin` permission to `Test1` , he cant see the folder `Test2`\n\nHowever, it is possible to know if such `folder/path` (Test2) exist in a site by guessing the names of the folder.\n\n\n**Steps**\n\n1.There are 2 `folders` in a site namely `Test1` and `Test2`\n2. Member has full `Admin` permission to `Test1` and no permission at all to `Test2`. Member wont be able to see the folder `Test2` in his account at all.\n3. Now member selects any file from `Test1` using checkbox and select move option from dropdown. he gets only path to `Test1` folders. \n4. now if i type some random names of the folders in the box and say move, it will throw the error. but if type the valid names of folders which may be in a site, it will say can not write. \n5. this proves that, if you can guess correct name of folder/path, it tells you the existence of the path.\n\n**POC**\nhttps://youtu.be/mzPXVHIDnzs\n\n**Resolution**\nThe response should be same for both requests. folder exist or not, it should throw 404!\n\n\n\n**The date you tested for and found the vulnerability**\n08/10/2016\n\n**The following affirmative statement **\nI HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THE BUG BOUNTY PROGRAM. I AGREE TO THE BRICKFTP TERMS OF SERVICE. I HAVE COMPLIED AND WILL COMPLY WITH THE RULES OF THE PROGRAM AND THE TERMS OF SERVICE. I HAVE NOT DISCLOSED THIS SUBMISSION TO ANYONE. I DISCOVERED IT MYSELF. I WILL NOT DISCLOSE THIS SUBMISSION TO ANYONE. I DO WANT MY NAME PUBLISHED ON YOUR HALL OF FAME IF THIS IS ACCEPTED\n",
