  "vulnerability_information": "Hi,\n\nThis issue is same as #128121 reported by a5tronaut.\nHe reported some of the usernames for restriction and you applied check only for those usernames. \nI think username restriction should applied for all the usersnames, those are used for a directory or a link in gratipay.\n\na5tronaut mentioned the sign-out.html. You restricted it but sign-out still is an available username. \n\nLike gratipay have the directory listing for following:\nProfile, Giving , History, Emails, Routes, Settings.\n\nBut none of the above is restricted for use as an username.\n\nI created my account of three of above username for POC purpose. When User of gratipay will click on the following link, he would expect the history, sign-out, settings page of gratipay. But he will end up visiting my gratipay account. \n\n**POC:**\nhttps://gratipay.com/sign-out/\nhttps://gratipay.com/History/\nhttps://gratipay.com/settings/\n\n**Fix:** \nYou can fix most of this username restriction issues by not allowing . (dot) in username as i suggested in my previous report and other usernames without \".\" dot can be restricted explicitly.\n\nThanks,\nAkash Saxena",
