  "vulnerability_information": "Hi Shopify,\n\nSo I was doing some scanning for another client and saw a ton of *.shopify.com appear and thought to myself \"Huh? I thought shopify.com hosted shops on myshopify.com.. weird, lets check this out\".\n\nAn example is this: http://khanbot.shopify.com/password - as you can see it's a store opening soon, but it's on *.shopify.com. However when I try my own store: http://imjusttesting8.shopify.com/password then it will give me the generic, \"Did you mean etc etc\". Very weird. I tried looking around and playing as much as possible, but I wasn't unable to actually get a *.shopify.com url. (If this is actually possible could you let me know how?)\n\nI found these via this BTW: https://crt.sh/?q=%25.shopify.com (there's quite a few more).\n\nOne that caught my eye was windsor.shopify.com. It's set to auto redirect to another domain (aislingofwindsor.com) which had actually expired. I purchased it and now when you visit windsor.shopify.com your redirected to a site I control. (yay for owning a shopify.com sub domain)\n\nPoC: https://windsor.shopify.com/ (can even use https to make it even more 'trustworthy')\n\nAn attack idea would be saying to users \"New product released by shopify! Increase your sales by using Windsor. Read more: https://windsor.shopify.com\" (users will see shopify.com and trust. Plus the fact it's a cool name like 'Windsor', may get users attention). \n\nWe could then in theory create a domain similar to shopify and redirect aislingofwindsor.com straight to another domain. Add all the HTTPS stuff to make it look even more real, and we have a pretty good attack surface!\n\nNote: I've done a lot of internal phishing for clients and had a 100% success rate every time, hence why i'm reporting this as I feel this url could be used to easily phish users.\n",
