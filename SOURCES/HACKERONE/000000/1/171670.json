  "vulnerability_information": "Hi there,\n\nWhile researching a website that uses your framework xss_clean() function to sanitize user's input in comments, I was able to bypass it and could trigger XSS payloads using javascript links in allowed tags such as anchors. This could be achieved by using the new HTML5 standard entities such as `&NewLine;` `&Tab;` `&colon;`\n\n### PoC\nRun the following piece of code under CI framework\n```\necho $this->security->xss_clean('<a href=\"javascript&NewLine;&colon;eval(String.fromCharCode(97, 108, 101, 114, 116, 40, 100, 111, 99, 117, 109, 101, 110, 116, 46, 100, 111, 109, 97, 105, 110, 41));\">XSS Link</a>');\n```\n**For a demo**\n1. Go to http://www.aorank.com/tutorial/codeigniter_xss_clean/index.php/form/ (*a demo of a tutorial illustrating xss_clean();*)\n2. In employee name's field, enter\n ```\n<a href=\"javascript&NewLine;&colon;eval(String.fromCharCode(97, 108, 101, 114, 116, 40, 100, 111, 99, 117, 109, 101, 110, 116, 46, 100, 111, 109, 97, 105, 110, 41));\">XSS Link</a>\n```\n3. Submit the form\n4. The payload is injected into the page and XSS vector is triggered as soon as user clicks the link.\n\n### Why?\nActually the website was using an old version of xss_clean() that did not take the new standard entities into consideration. However, when I downloaded the latest version of CI to see if this is fixed, I noticed that you check if they exist and handle them accordingly but there is a flaw in the regular expression used to detect standard entities that causes the XSS bypass.\n\nIn line 677 in ./system/core/Security.php\n`if (preg_match_all('/&[a-z]{2,}(?![a-z;])/i', $str, $matches))`\n\nWe can see that this regular expression matches alpha characters preceded by ampersand (&) and **not followed** by a semi-colon (;) --*I have no idea why you do this BTW, since entities are usually followed by a semicolon :D*--\n\nSo when user injects `&NewLine;` and/or `&Tab;` they are not detected by the regular expression and hence not converted to their corresponding characters. That's why the XSS filter fails to detect the presence `javascript:` in the attribute.\n\n### Remediation\nRegular expression should be fixed to count for entities followed by a semi-colon :))\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon ^_^\n\nSincerely,\nAbood Nour\n",
