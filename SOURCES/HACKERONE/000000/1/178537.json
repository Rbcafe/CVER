  "vulnerability_information": "Hey New Relic Security team,\n\nI noticed what appeared to be a configuration oversight and I wanted to mention it to you. The following domains are currently pointing to Fastly:\n\n```\nfr.newrelic.com\t151.101.192.207\nes.newrelic.com\t151.101.0.207\n```\n\nWhen you visit them, you should see something like this:\n\n>\"Fastly error: unknown domain: fr.newrelic.com. Please check that this domain has been added to a service.\"\n\nI've never exploited a configuration issue like this but, I suspect, it could be an interesting attack vector if someone was attacking New Relic with malicious intent. Theoretically, if I were to exploit this further, I would see if I could associate these with my own Fastly account and find a way to serve my own content when requests are made to these New Relic domains.\n\nHere's a similar report that Shopify received:\n\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/165309\n\nCheers!\nDaniel Hartnell",
