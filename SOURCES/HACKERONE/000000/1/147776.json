  "vulnerability_information": "Hi again badoo team , \nIn `https://corp.badoo.com/jobs/?p=` if you check the page you'll see an iframe from `https://jobs.jobvite.com/badoo/` , the `p` parameter is used to control the iframe link for example if you added `https://corp.badoo.com/jobs/?p=some_path` the iframe link will be `https://jobs.jobvite.com/badoo/some_path` , I have tried to set the `p` parameter to something like `../something_else` but the code checks if the parameter contains double dots and if it does , it just sets the iframe url to `https://jobs.jobvite.com/badoo/` in order to prevent showing content from other jobvite account's , however I have found a way to bypass this by adding a *Newline* `%0A` character between the two dots. \n\n#PoC:\nhttps://corp.badoo.com/jobs/?jkl&p=.%0A./jobvite --> This will show jobvite's open jobs instead of showing badoo's \n\nSomeone can simply create a jobvite account and make it appear on corp.badoo.com by sending the victim a link like `https://corp.badoo.com/jobs/?jkl&p=.%0A./<jobvite_account_handle>` and trick him to provide sensitive information such as emails , names , phone number , images ..etc. since the victim believes that it's badoo's careers page and trusts it.\n\nHere is another PoC:\nhttps://corp.badoo.com/jobs/?jkl&p=.%0A./jobvite/job/o0PBZfw9/apply --> This will show an application form (The attacker can control it) \n \nThe severity of this issue lies in the nature of the page , since the victim trusts it and believes that it's badoo's careers page , he will provide sensitive information about himself thinking that he is applying for a job at badoo , then the attacker can use these sensitive information for even more malicious actions.\nIt can even be used for phishing due to the fact that you control the form fields in jobvite, so someone can create a phishing inside corp.badoo.com and trick users to submit their passwords.\n\nThanks",
