  "vulnerability_information": "Hi,\n\nWhile this doesn't fall directly under the Program scope, I feel that the subject of this report is directly connected to the primary Legal Robot web properties and would like to inform your team in case this was a misconfiguration concern.\n\nI noticed that **legalrobot.amazonaws.com** is configured to display a publicly readable root directory listing, and believe this AWS S3 bucket may be associated with Legal Robot systems.\n\nIt is possible to read data from this bucket; AWS GET requests (from the v2 API) can also be used to retrieve modified data views. Given that buckets with other name permutations are set to `AccessDenied`, this appears to be an **ACL misconfiguration**.\n\nIn terms of attack scenario, if Legal Robot engineers upload new sensitive material (e.g. proprietary data) to the bucket, believing that the ACL is correctly configured, there may be a risk to Legal Robot as a result, hence why all other buckets are restricted.\n\nUnfortunately my personal AWS account is inactive, so I have been unable to confirm the ability of an unaffiliated user writing files into the **legalrobot** bucket.\n\nThanks!",
