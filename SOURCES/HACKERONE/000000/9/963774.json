  "vulnerability_information": "Hello, I reported a bug to support@hey.com a couple weeks ago, not realizing that I was a member of the private bug bounty program. It was fixed quickly (Less than 1 hour) which was awesome to see. Being that this was reported through a seperate channel, and it is for Hey, I'm not even sure it would eligible here. Either way, it was a pretty neat bug becuase of its simplicity and clear impact (loss of revenue). \n\nAnyways, here it is:\n\nThere appears to be a bypass for the premium email address sign up. \n\nWhen signing up for Hey, I tried to obtain jp@hey.com, which prompted a Premium alert box that stated it would cost $999 per year. Since that wouldn't work for me, I tried 'jp  @hey.com' (two spaces), this worked without prompting me to accept that it was a premium email address. \n\nIt appears that the spaces are registered as characters, so it's not considered a premium domain (at 4 chars), but the spaces are stripped at a later step and I am given a two character premium email address for the same cost as a non-premium email address.\n\nNow, it appears I can lock this email address in for $99 per year just like a typical email address on the Hey platform.\n\n## Impact\n\nAt the time, the impact was that an premium account (less than 4 chars) could be registered for the non-premium price of $99, which is substantially cheaper than the $999 price tag.",
