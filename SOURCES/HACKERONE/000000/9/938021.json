      "content": "We received a report from @pandaaaa wherein he demonstrated a way to avail Zomato Gold membership using random Zomato User's wallet. The report was triaged and rewarded with critical severity with a `CVSS score of 9.3`. \n\nIt was considered critical since a random user's wallet could have been used for unauthorized membership purchases. This was only possible on third party wallets with `status - active` flag.\n\n| Timeline | Action |\n|---|---|\n| Thu, 23 July 2020, 15:54 IST | @pandaaaa submitted a report with high severity |\n| Thu, 23 July 2020, 16:08 IST | Investigation started, the team started analysing the issue |\n| Thu, 23 July 2020, 16:47 IST | First contact on Report |\n| Thu, 23 July 2020, 16:51 IST | Security Team reproduced the issue |\n| Thu, 23 July 2020, 16:54 IST | Internal ticket logged and assigned to the Engineering Team |\n| Thu, 23 July 2020, 16:54 IST | Severity upgraded from high to critical (9.3 CVSS) by Security team |\n| Thu, 23 July 2020, 17:01 IST | Report triaged |\n| Thu, 23 July 2020, 17:12 IST | Bounty rewarded to @pandaaaa  |\n| Thu, 23 July 2020, 18:11 IST | Fix deployed on production |\n| Thu, 23 July 2020, 18:49 IST | Re-test requested from @pandaaaa to validate the fix |\n| Thu, 23 July 2020, 20:03 IST | The researcher confirmed the fix |\n\n**Response time for this report:**\n\n- Investigation started within ***14 minutes***\n- Reproduced within ***59 minutes***\n- Triaged within ***1 hour, 7 minutes***\n- Rewarded within ***1 hour, 12 minutes***\n- Fixed within ***2 hours, 17 minutes***\n\n### Background\n\nIn Zomato, each user has multiple payment types, one of such payment type is third-party wallets. While purchasing Gold, the user can select the Payment method, if a user selects wallets as payment type, the user can select any of the wallets and the wallet is passed on to the backend, here, there was no check to associate `wallet id` with the user id, so it was possible to use other user's `wallet id`.\n\n### Root cause Analysis\n\n**This was introduced because of a recent code change that went live 13 hours ago.**\n\n- Zomato allows users to avail Gold membership which is being handled by this particular request `https://www.zomato.com/php/pk_handler.php`.\n\n- To successfully purchase the membership, a series of calls are needed to be processed in a particular order. \n\n- In the First call, user phone number and membership price is sent\n\n```rb\ncase=getpaymentsdataphone=XXXXXXXcart_value=999.00service_type=REDonline_payments_flag=1country_id=X\n```\nit then returns all the payment methods available and the last payment method used for a user. \n\n- For the relevance of this report, only payment methods of `wallet_type` as `third_party_wallet` and `status` as `active` are needed. \n\n```rb\n{  \"wallet_id\": 8XXXXXXX3,  \"balance\": 0.01,  \"currency\": \"INR\",  \"user_id\": \"14XXXXX2\",  \"entity_id\": \"14XXXX2\",  \"entity_type\": \"user\",  \"country_id\": 1,  \"status\": \"active\",  \"vault\": \"paytm\",  \"storage_state\": \"retained\",  \"reference_id\": XXXXXXXXX,  \"phone\": \"XXXXXXXXX\",  \"email\": \"XXXXXXXXX@gmail.com\",  \"expires\": XXXXXXXXX,  \"balance_display\": \"₹0.01\",  \"max_recharge_amount\": XXXXXXXXXX,  \"wallet_type\": \"third_party_wallet\",  \"img_url\": \"https://b.zmtcdn.com/payments/wallet-logos/paytm.png\",  \"display_text\": \"Paytm\",  \"recharge_available\": 1}\n```\n\n- On the next call, Payment type selected is used to perform the actual transaction on `https://www.zomato.com/php/red/desktop_payments_handler.php`\n\n```rb\npayment_method_id=8XXXXXX1payment_method_type=walletphone=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXcartValue=999.00voucher_code=action=paymentis_renewal=0user_id=1XXXXX2tnc_accepted=false\n```\nwhich returns\n\n```rb\n{  \"status\": \"success\",  \"track_id\": \"ZRD-XXXXXXXXXXXX\",  \"response_message\": \"Capture Successful\",  \"message\": \"\",  \"code\": 0,  \"subscription_id\": XXXXXXX,  \"amount\": 999,  \"city_id\": 1,  \"upgrade_plan_flag\": 0,  \"restart_subscription_flag\": 0,  \"transaction_id\": XXXXXXXXX,  \"thankyou_page_type\": \"thankyou_inactive\",  \"text\": \"You are now a Zomato Gold member\",  \"redirect_url\": \"https://www.zomato.com/gold/payment-success?subscription_id=XXXXXX&user_id=XXXXXXXX&is_first_time=1&order_id=XXXXXXX\"}\n```\n\n- There was no check while performing the transaction to validate if the `wallet id` actually belonged to the user who initiated the call.\n\n### Remediation\n\n- Since it could have allowed to use any random user's `wallet_id` to purchase a Gold membership, the first thing we did was to investigate and see if it was abused since the introduction of this vulnerability.\n\n- **We found no evidence of it being abused** apart from `2 transactions` wherein both of them were test transactions to actually validate/test the issue, one was from @pandaaaa and the other one was from our internal team.\n\n- Our engineers immediately patched the issue and the patch was pushed to production within 2 hours and 17 mins` from the report.\n\nThanks, @pandaaaa for helping us keep @zomato secure.\n\nZomato Security Team",
