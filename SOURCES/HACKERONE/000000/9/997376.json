  "vulnerability_information": "Greetings, i've find a External service interaction (HTTP/DNS) on https://www.███████\n\n```\nExternal service interaction arises when it is possible to induce an application to interact with an arbitrary external service, \nsuch as a web or mail server. \nThe ability to trigger arbitrary external service interactions does not constitute a vulnerability in its own right, \nand in some cases might even be the intended behavior of the application. \nHowever, in many cases, it can indicate a vulnerability with serious consequences.\n\nIn cases where DNS-based interactions can be triggered, it is normally possible to trigger interactions using other service types, \nand these are reported as separate issues.\n If a payload that specifies a particular service type (e.g. a URL) triggers only a DNS-based interaction, \nthen this strongly indicates that the application attempted to connect using that other service, \nbut was prevented from doing so by egress filters in place at the network layer. \nThe ability to send requests to other systems can allow the vulnerable server to be used as an attack proxy. \nBy submitting suitable payloads, an attacker can cause the application server to attack other systems that it can interact with. \nThis may include public third-party systems, internal systems within the same organization, \nor services available on the local loopback adapter of the application server itself. Depending on the network architecture, \nthis may expose highly vulnerable internal services that are not otherwise accessible to external attackers.\n```\nhttps://portswigger.net/kb/issues/00300200_external-service-interaction-dns\n\nFull link  : https://www.██████/█████\n\nPOST Request : \n\n```\n████████&MONTH=01&LNAME=frenchvlad&PHONE=555-555-0199&EDULVL=10&STATE=AL&EMAILFLAG=on&submitButton=Submit+Audition+Request&EMAIL=frenchvlad@example.com&ADD1=555-555-0199@frenchvlad.com&██████=http://bcrxn9tx1eboqdat33ghligdv41upj.burpcollaborator.net/?Winterville&ADD2=555-555-0199@frenchvlad.com&INST1MOS=Bass+Guitar&CITY=Winterville&YEAR=2003&INST1YRS=2+TO+5&DAY=01&CITIZEN=R\n```\n\nmy payload : `█████████=http://bcrxn9tx1eboqdat33ghligdv41upj.burpcollaborator.net/?Winterville`\n\nProof (DNS) : \n\n██████\n\nProof (HTTP) : \n\n█████\n\nbest regards, \nfrenchvlad\n\n## Impact\n\nWe can use the weakness as a attack proxy to DDOS all Internal/external web conatiners, also could be amplified too",
