Here, adding the required information: \n\n##Title: Server-Side Request Forgery in \"icons.bitwarden.net\".\n##URL: https://icons.bitwarden.net/spoofed.burpcollaborator.net/icon.png\n##Parameter: REST based in \"https://icons.bitwarden.net/{DOMAIN-HERE}/icon.png\"\n##Summary: The application failed to validate the vulnerable URL which led to internal port scanning through SSRF vulnerability. \n##Severity: High\n\n##Proof of Concept: \n1. The application shows \"https://icons.bitwarden.net/localhost/icon.png\". - 400 Bad Request.\n2. The application shows https://icons.bitwarden.net/spoofed.burpcollaborator.net/icon.png - 404 Not Found.\nNote: Furthermore, an attacker would be able to perform host discovery and internal port scanning which I did not perform as the scope was not mentioned in the list so better that you can proceed with the above Proof of Concept steps. \n\n##Recommendation:\nIn the above steps, localhost was restricted but was able to bypass using domain \"spoofed.burpcollaborator.net\" which resolves \"127.0.0.1\". The application should resolve the domain and restrict access to internal resources.\n\n## Impact\n\n* An attacker would be able to perform SSRF attack to retrieve internal infrastructure information.",
