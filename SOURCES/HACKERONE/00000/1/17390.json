  "vulnerability_information": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThere's a **Flash Content-Type Sniffing vulnerability**. Using this vulnerability I can read the client side source code of your website from a different origin (say prakharprasad.com) and then look for potentially sensitive data in those pages for example - CSRF prevention tokens and then successfully mount a side-wide CSRF attack (as I can read the token every time and on every page) or read messages. Once the victim views my page, I can read his `https://staging.uzbey.com/*` webpage source and then extract out the data I need (messages, anti-csrf tokens and what not).\r\n\r\n**Proof-of-Concept**:\r\n\r\n1. Login to your Uzbey account\r\n2. Visit https://demo.prakharprasad.com/uzbey/uzbey.html (and wait for 5 -10 seconds)\r\n3. Now visit https://staging.uzbey.com/messages and you'll see a message has been sent to *admin* saying *DemoHAX :)* \r\n\r\n**How this works?**\r\n\r\n1. My webpage loads an `<iframe>` pointing to https://demo.prakharprasad.com/uzbey/sniff.html\r\n2. `sniff.html` essentially embeds an SWF-file that has been uploaded to my (attacker's) photo gallery with **.jpg** extension - https://staging.uzbey.com/sites/default/files/magic.jpg \r\n3. Once the embedded file run, it sends a **GET** request to `https://staging.uzbey.com/messages/new`and passes the callback to a function called `nice()`within `sniff.html`. The callback data is the source code of the page that was requested with a **GET** earlier.\r\n4. Now`nice()`function parses the page for `form_bulid_id`and `form_token` and then builds up a form to mount the CSRF attack and then submits the form with a **POST** request. \r\n5. **Game over ! :)**\r\n\r\nBasically I used the upload functionality to upload the malicious SWF with **.jpg** extension and then loaded it in an iframe and did my work!\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\n@prakharprasad",
