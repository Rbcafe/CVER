  "vulnerability_information": "URL :- https://www.reddapi.com/docs/\r\n\r\nDescription :-\r\nThere was no \"Strict-Transport-Security\" header in the server response.\r\n\r\nRemediation detail :-\r\nA Strict-Transport-Security HTTP header should be sent with each HTTPS response. The syntax is as follows:\r\n\r\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=<seconds>[; includeSubDomains]\r\n\r\nThe parameter max-age gives the time frame for requirement of HTTPS in seconds and should be chosen quite high, e.g. several months. A value below 7776000 is considered as too low by this scanner check. The flag includeSubDomains defines that the policy applies also for sub domains of the sender of the response.\r\n\r\nIssue background :-\r\nThe HTTP Strict Transport Security policy defines a timeframe where a browser must connect to the web server via HTTPS. Without a Strict Transport Security policy the web application may be vulnerable against several attacks:\r\nIf the web application mixes usage of HTTP and HTTPS, an attacker can manipulate pages in the unsecured area of the application or change redirection targets in a manner that the switch to the secured page is not performed or done in a manner, that the attacker remains between client and server.\r\nIf there is no HTTP server, an attacker in the same network could simulate a HTTP server and motivate the user to click on a prepared URL by a scoial engineering attack.\r\nThe protection is effective only for the given amount of time. Multiple occurrence of this header could cause undefined behaviour in browsers and should be avoided.",
