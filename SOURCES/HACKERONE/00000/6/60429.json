  "vulnerability_information": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThis bug is a design flaw in the reputation system.\r\n\r\nSimply, when a bug is resolved `+7`  is added to the user's account. When bounty is awarded then the reputation points are calculated based on standard deviation from the program's mean.\r\n\r\nI found these here ---> <https://hackerone.com/news/introducing-reputation>\r\n>You gain reputation when:\r\nYour report is Closed as Resolved: +7\r\nYour report is Closed as Duplicate (Resolved): +2. Only applied if reported before the original was closed.\r\nYou are awarded a bounty. The amount is based on standard deviation from the program's mean:\r\n+50: $ >= µ + 1σ\r\n+25: $ >  µ\r\n+15: $ >= µ - 1σ\r\n+10: $ <  µ - 1σ\r\nYour report is Closed as Won't Fix: +1\r\nYour report is Closed as Duplicate (Won't Fix): +1\r\n\r\n>You lose reputation when:\r\nYour report is Closed as Not Applicable: -5\r\nYour report is Closed as Duplicate (Not Applicable): -5\r\nYour report is updated as Needs more info: -1\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Now, one reporter can earn max of `+50` reputation points if award is far maximum than program's min bounty amount.\r\n2. Also, when report is marked as `Resolved` then `+7` are added.\r\n3. So, totally max of `+57` points can be made from a single bug report.\r\n\r\nBut there exists a flaw which will allow to boost reputation points more than `+57`. \r\n1.  A report is awarded bounty of `$350` but minimum bounty of program is `$100`. So, this adds `+50` reputation points to the reporter.\r\n2. Now, report is marked resolved, so `+7` reputation points are added.\r\n3. Now, if same report is awarded with bounty `$150`, then it will again add `+15`.\r\n\r\nSo, if a report is rewarded again and again then it will boost reputation points more than default `+57`. So, this totally contradicts the policy mentioned here ---> <https://hackerone.com/news/introducing-reputation>\r\nDue to this flaw, reporter will earn more reputation points more than other researchers.\r\ni.e If researcher two reports a severe bug then he will get `+50` and `+7`. Total of `+57`. (Total bounty 1000$)\r\nBut at the 1st researcher's report is being rewarded again and again. It will boost as `+50` and `+7` and again awarded so `+15`. Total `+72`.(Total bounty 350$ + 150$ = 500$)\r\n\r\nI hope you understand the severity here and modify the reputation system accordingly. I found this bug on my own account. So, I am attaching an image poc of my account. Sensitive information has been forged. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPranav",
