I agree with the finding that this is a non issue for jsDelivr as a site. Its just that the customers are impacted coz they are using vulnerable version of the javascript originating from your end.\n\nHowever there are other concerns about the website functionality all together. On one side its claimed that the users should use newer version on the other side as the documented bug reports on github point to the fact that they rely soly on someone else to provide them the update. Is it not a due deligence requirement of the website to ensure new versions are made available. Even if a user wanted to use the new version it was not available on the website. \n\nBesides this although new is what should be used is it not something like a no brainer to put a notice on website if someone selects an older version that this is vulnerable and not to used or just deprecated.\n\nThe aim of the issue was never to earn bounty but rather to have a conversation to identify what could be done.\n\n\n ",
