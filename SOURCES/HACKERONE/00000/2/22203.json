Don't use the password reset link.\r\n3) Login using the same password back and update your email address to \"efgh@x.com\" and verify the same.\r\n4) Now logout and use the password reset link which was mailed to \"abcd@x.com\" in step 2.\r\n5) You can see that it is possible to change the password.\r\nHere  the password reset link of \"abcd@x.com\" which was old email address associated with twitter can be use to change the password of twitter account having  updated email address \"efgh@x.com\".\r\n\r\nAttack scenario:\r\nIf victim's previous \"abcd@x.com\" account was compromised, he decided to updated his twitter email address to \"efgh@x.com\" but before updating by mistake he asked for password reset link. As a result his twitter account will be compromised by the attacker.\r\n\r\nFix: As soon as new email address is updated all the previous links should also get expired.\r\n\r\nIf you want further information please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks and regards.\r\nMohd Haji",
