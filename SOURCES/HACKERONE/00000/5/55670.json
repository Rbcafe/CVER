  "vulnerability_information": "When an admin is deleted from an organization, his access rights are not removed properly. This allows an ex-admin to delete team members from the organization.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with attack,\r\n\r\n1. Create an organization with two accounts.  Lets say,  VictimOrg - Victimadmin, Victimmember\r\n\r\n2. Invite Hackeradmin to VictimOrg and change his role to admin. At this point Hackeradmin can login and grab VictimOrg & Victimmember ids.\r\n\r\n     VictimOrg id:54af7e07b8568e8c6a0001e\r\n     Victimmember id:552787195127ae16b8000987\r\n\r\n3. Delete Hackeradmin from VictimOrg. Now, Hakeradmin is not a member of VictimOrg anymore. Ideally, he does not have rights to access/make changes to VictimOrg. However, he can still delete team members from the VictimOrg.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps listed below shows that Hackeradmin can delete Victimmember from VictimOrg:\r\n\r\n1. Log into fabric.io as Hackeradmin.\r\n2. Navigate to settings->organizations->HackerOrg->Team member link.\r\n3. Click on x symbol corresponding to Hackermember to remove him from HackerOrg. Intercept this request using burp proxy.\r\n\r\n    Proxy shows a similar request as below,\r\n\t\r\n\tDELETE /api/v3/accounts/54c1e78b9ea696b3cb00026a/organizations/54aa36e3937ae35559011d17/leave HTTP/1.1\r\n\tHost: fabric.io\r\n\r\n4. In the intercepted request replace the account id with Victimmember id and org id with VictimOrg id.\r\n\r\n\tModified request is,\r\n\t\r\n\tDELETE /api/v3/accounts/552787195127ae16b8000987/organizations/54af7e07b8568e8c6a0001e/leave HTTP/1.1\r\n\tHost: fabric.io\r\n\r\n5. Send the modified request to the server and it removes Victimmember from VictimOrg. \r\n6. To confirm, login as Victimadmin and look at the VictimOrg team members. \r\n",
