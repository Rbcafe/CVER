  "vulnerability_information": "Hello HackerOne,\r\n\r\nI found out that it's easy to publish a program that isn't yours.\r\n\r\n``` January 20, 2015 ```\r\nI created a program named *Puffer Bird* and I leave the sandbox to prepare to launch the program.\r\nThen, I requested for a program review.\r\n\r\n``` January 21, 2014 at 1:08 AM ```\r\nI received an email from ██████@hackerone. \r\n\r\n>At this time HackerOne is unable to validate the program because of multiple factors. Initial validation can begin by sending an email from the Pufferbird.com to support@hackerone.com. Additional details may be required to confirm your identity and the company.\r\n> \r\n>Thank you.\r\n\r\nSo, I went to a [Hosting Website](http://hostinger.ph), I created a New Account to create a domain *pufferbird.com* . \r\nScreenshot: http://i.imgur.com/d6rgPX8.png\r\nAfter creating the domain, I created an email *no-reply@pufferbird.com*\r\nScreenshot: http://i.imgur.com/oeh83fH.png\r\nThen, I sent an email to ██████@hackerone.com\r\nScreenshot: http://i.imgur.com/C1v0XHg.png\r\nAnd It has been sent successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:  Because the domain I created is not pointing to host's nameservers, services like email will not work correctly but it can sent an email but not able to receive.\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n``` January 23, 2015 at 9:17 PM ```\r\nI sent another email directly to ██████@hackerone.com using my own and real email.\r\n\r\n\r\n``` January 24, 2015 at 12:23 AM ```\r\nI received an email that the program has been approved.\r\nScreenshot: http://i.imgur.com/5DBJnaE.png\r\n\r\nShort Recap:\r\nI made a program\r\nLeave the sandbox to request review\r\n██████@hackerone.com emailed me for validation of the program\r\nI validate the program using the fake pufferbird.com email address\r\nI emailed ██████@hackerone.com that I already sent the email which contains information about the program.\r\nno-reply@hackerone.com[HackerOne] emailed that the program has been approved.\r\n\r\nScreenshot: http://i.imgur.com/ZiuUOY9.png\r\n\r\n~ @atom\r\n\r\n",
