  "vulnerability_information": "Hello Twitter Security Team, \r\n\r\nI reccomend you to read this report with the maximum attention!\r\n\r\nThis is the same isse that you ever see here: https://hackerone.com/reports/42236 and here https://hackerone.com/reports/32825.\r\n\r\nWell ,now, the acquisition where I found this domain is: trendrr.tv..Before say something, just let me go in the deep of this report and of this domain.\r\n\r\nLong time ago, when Twitter doesn't had his personal Bug Bounty Program on Hackerone, and have just his forms for researcher who want to report something, I reported some issues on some of your acquisitions and some got rejected (Not because the vulns where in the acq, but because the issue doesn't had a serious impact for you at their time)..  but one issue was accepted and fixed from yoru Security Team luckily, and was a issue on...TRENDRRTV!\r\n\r\nIn that time, I reported a vulenrability about renegotiation, I reccomed you to see these two screenshots below to refresh your memory:\r\n\r\n1) http://grabilla.com/05115-39f04d06-370b-49eb-9355-b6fff4971584.html (Your first reply)\r\n\r\n2) http://grabilla.com/05115-ad54a47d-e136-4f9f-9fc0-5ccb90737383.html (From this reply, I understood that you was going to fix that issue.)\r\n\r\n3) http://grabilla.com/05115-0a4a4255-95ae-445f-b263-26eca02aab1d.html (Here you told me that I was going to get listed there and some months later I got the reply wich says that \"You're in the HOF for year 2014\" and in the same date, and two days later, I've checked the issue and the issue was fixed.\r\n\r\nNow the point is..old time, new time, no matters. Today, I am here because I want to report this issue because is a valid bug, and it's a fruit from my hard work.\r\n\r\nI saw that now all domain of trendrr has been shutting down except one, the onwewich I found to be vulnerable: the domain is support.trendrr.tv, that is an alias for trendrr.zendesk.com.\r\n\r\nI visited the TRENDRR support website and it says: \"No help desk at support.trendrr.tv\r\nThere is no help desk configured at this address. This means that the address is available and that you can claim it at http://www.zendesk.com/signup/\"----->Here a screen wich proof that: http://grabilla.com/05115-db455e78-830e-43dd-b562-c839672cb14e.html, So once it's expire I can claim it.\r\n\r\nAnd once claimed it, if you try to navigate with your browser to support.trendrr.tv  (Since this is an Alias (so is pointing out to a specific domain) for trendrr.zendesk.com as proof this screen: http://grabilla.com/05115-6d3ed6d5-494c-4c38-b0b6-3539e5161d6d.html ) you will redirect to trendrr.zendesk.com, that is my domain takeovered! :)\r\n\r\nPOC(s) of the subdomain takeover: \r\n\r\n1) http://grabilla.com/05115-27247cde-c11a-4dd0-a684-8d39ae5f4178.html\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n2) http://grabilla.com/05115-5e623c93-2657-4e45-a0af-4ff41593a4fc.html\r\n\r\nSince I have complete control over the subdomain I can do whatever I want on it, be careful about that!\r\n\r\nPs: Even if is an acquisition and most of TRENDRR domains has been shutt-down, I except a small bounty for this, or better...I hope! =)\r\n\r\nPlease fix it as soon as possible , and let me know if you need any further information.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nSimone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
