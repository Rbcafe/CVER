  "vulnerability_information": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how serious this is to be honest. If you're downloading tracks without paying, then I'm sure you could find a copy somewhere on the internet anyway. But I guess it's still an issue.\r\n\r\nWhen browsing the Music Store (https://vimeo.com/musicstore), some tracks are free. To download these, a `GET` request is sent to `/musicstore/download`, with a query string of `track_id=[track_id]&license_id=4`.\r\n\r\nFor non-free tracks, the link is replaced with an Add to Cart icon, and you're expected to go through the checkout procedure. This is done by a `POST` request to `/cart/music`with a body of `action=add&license_id=2&license_name=Personal&price=1.99&track_id=110947&track_title=Remind%2BMe&uid=110947_2&&&token=[token]`.\r\n\r\nCopying the `track_id` from the Add to Cart request and transplanting it into the `/musicstore/download` successfully redirects you to Amazon S3 to download the track, despite you not having paid for it.\r\n\r\nNote: I submitted the `GET` request to `/musicstore/download`, but didn't follow the 302 redirect to S3 to download the track since I didn't pay for it. Because of this I can't 100% verify that the resulting file is the track, but judging by the URL it looks like it is.\r\n\r\n### Proof-of-Concept\r\n**Accounts Needed**\r\n* User #1 - Standard Vimeo user\r\n\r\n**Steps**\r\n1. Login, and browse to https://vimeo.com/musicstore\r\n2. Find a **non-free** track, and click the Add to Cart icon\r\n3. Inside the `POST` request to `/cart/music` copy the `track_id`\r\n4. Browse to the following URL, replacing `[track_id]` with the one from step 3. You should be redirected to S3 to download the track (without paying): `https://vimeo.com/musicstore/download?track_id=[track_id]&license_id=4`\r\n\r\nIf you need anymore info just shout,\r\nCheers,\r\nJack",
