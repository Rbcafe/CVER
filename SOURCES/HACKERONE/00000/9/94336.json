  "vulnerability_information": "Hello,\n\nPrivileged information is getting leaked to an unauthorized user in the json response of `https://hackerone.com/reports/<report id>.json`.\n\nIn a team there can be many members, also roles are defined. But an x-member of the team is getting information which should not be visible to him. (As I tested it on sandboxed team but it i believe it is also affecting other private programs )\n\nProof Of Concept :\n================\n1. UserA is part of TeamA.\n2. UserA creates a test report.\n3. Now, UserA can access the report via `Reports` tab.\n4. Admin now removes the UserA from the team.\n5. Now, UserA becomes X-user of the team.\n6. UserA canNOT access the team.\n7. But can access the test report which he/she created.\n\nWhen UserA accesses the report then a request is made to `https://hackerone.com/reports/<report id>.json`. Note the response for my test report.\n\n``\n{id: 94333, url: \"https://hackerone.com/reports/94333\", title: \"asdf\", state: \"Open\", substate: \"new\",…}\nabilities: {can_manage?: false, can_export?: false, can_add_comment?: true, can_change_state?: false,…}\nactivities: []\nbug_reporter_agreed_on_going_public_at: null\ncan_view_team: true\ncreated_at: \"2015-10-17T04:29:44.364Z\"\ncve_ids: []\ndisclosed_at: null\nexternal_advisory_url: null\nhas_bounty?: false\nid: 94333\nis_external_bug: false\nis_member_of_team?: false\nis_participant: true\nminimum_bounty: 1000\npublic: false\nreadable_substate: \"New\"\n....\n``\n\nHere, some fields like `minimum_bounty: 1000` and relevant team details are leaked. These fields are meant for only to people to whom the team is visible.\n\nAttack Scenario :\n==============\nI tested this bug on sandboxed team. But I believe this bug will affect the on going programs. Consider the scenario ...\nPrivate Program invites a User. User submits a bug. This bug will be visible to the user via `Reports` tab. Now, team decides to remove the User and removes him/her. Now, User can still get updates of the programs via the json response. The `team information` and `bounty details` are meant for only researchers who are invited to the program and people who are part of the team. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\nThanks,\nPranav",
