  "vulnerability_information": "Hi , I have found that if a staff member had access to `settings` for one single time , he can add his amazon marketplace web services account to the store anytime he wants even after he is deleted from the admins which allows him to fulfill orders for the online store using his own inventory stored at Amazon fulfilment center.\n#Scenario: \nLet's say that the store owner added a new staff member and gave him access to `settings` then he decided to delete him for some reason. \nAfter the staff member is deleted he can still  activate Amazon Fulfillment services by adding any number of amazon accounts to the store and even the store owner can't do anything to prevent this. \n#Steps to reproduce:\n1. Add a new staff member and give him access to `settings`. \n2. Login with the Staff member account and go to `https://<your_store>.myshopify.com/admin/fulfillment_services/signup_for_mws` , you'll be redirected to a link in amazon.com that looks like this :\n\n```\nhttps://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/mws/registration/register.html/188-6388224-3450104?ie=UTF8&AWSAccessKeyId=<KEY>&Signature=<Sginature>&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&id=<id>&returnPathAndParameters=%3Fshop_id%3D000000&signInPageDisplayed=1\n```\n3.- Save this link then logout and login with the owner account after that delete the staff member account you have added. \n5.- Open a new browser , go to the link you have saved , login with your amazon account , authorize shopify and the account will be added to the store.\n6.- login to the store admin then go to `https://<your_store>.myshopify.com/admin/settings/shipping/fulfillment_dropshipping` and you'll see that the account was added.\n7 - Do the step #5 more and more and the account will be added more and more times. \n\nThis means that the link you saved can be used anytime to add unlimited malicious amazon marketplace web services account without any need of admin access.\n\nThe cause of the vulnerability is that the endpoint used to add the amazon account is (`https://app.shopify.com/services/ping/amazon_mws?shop_id=<Shop_id> `) and doesn't validate for any admin permissions.\n\nPlease tell me if you are having any issue reproducing this , I can send you a PoC video.",
