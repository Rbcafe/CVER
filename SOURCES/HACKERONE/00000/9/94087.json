  "vulnerability_information": "Short\n====\nAn attacker is able to read arbitrary files from the delivery app storage if the bucket key is known to him.\n\nVector\n====\n1) The victim uploads a.png to a product his shop located at https://myhackeronestore.myshopify.com.\n1a) The file is stored at s3://shopify-delivery-app-storage/files/myhackeronestore.myshopify.com/5682196162/a.png\n2) The attacker uploads b.png to a product in his shop (location irrelevant) and changes the 'attachment[filepath]' parameter from \"b.png\" to \"b.png/../../../../files/myhackeronestore.myshopify.com/5682196162/a.png\" in the initial call to /attachments.\n3) The attacker will now go ahead an generate a manual download link for his newly created attachment\n3a) When he visits the generated manual download link the site will state \"b.png/../../../../files/myhackeronestore.myshopify.com/5682196162/a.png\" as the file name\n3b) When the attacker proceeds to press the download button he'll get a working link to get a.png from the victim.\n\nWhat's wrong here\n====\nThe attacker is able to craft the bucket key in a way to use path traversals (and possibly other wired things related to AWS S3 key names) to get files he shouldn't have access to. \n\nHow it should be\n====\nIn an ideal world the delivery app should control 100% of the bucket key name to make sure no harm can be done by attacks like this. This could be achieved by having a mapping from uploaded_filename to actual_key_in_s3 (is there a way to tell S3 how the downloaded file should be named?). \n\nConclusion\n====\nIn my book this is fraud and shouldn't be there ;) You might consider the approach to control 100% of the bucket key to rule an entire class of bugs/vulnerabilities here out as filtering of the filename is tricky and will probably fail (now or in the near feature, who knows what S3 offers as a neat new 'feature' in the future).  Also there are just too many variants on how things could get wrong, what comes to mind is: Encoding interpretation failures on the app side, hidden/not well documented features on the AWS side,...",
