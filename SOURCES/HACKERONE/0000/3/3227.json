  "vulnerability_information": "Hey,\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm not sure if there is any *real* security implications of this bug, but it's (IMO) something which should be fixed at some point (since it'll be pretty easy).\r\n\r\nOn signup, the username you chose has to be alphanumeric. If you submit someone else's username, followed by a null-byte (`%00`), you'll get an error indicating that the username has been taken (expected behaviour). Same with `%20`. However, if you submit the username followed by a control character, such as a new line (`%0a`), the request will go through and you'll be signed up.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of consequences of this. The first is that your profile can't be viewed (which also means you can't update your own settings!). You'll get a 404.\r\n\r\nThe second is that any bug reports you submit will look like another user submitted them. Again, not that big of a deal.\r\n\r\n### Proof-of-Concept\r\n1. Browse to https://hackerone.com/users/sign_up\r\n2. Enter any details, make sure your username is followed by `%0a` (use Burp to append it)\r\n3. Confirm your email, then login\r\n4. Click your profile picture in the top right\r\n5. You'll get a 404\r\n\r\nIf you need anymore information just shout,\r\nCheers,\r\nJack",
