To compile, run 'make' or 'makeall'

baseline-test:
	This performs a baseline test on the average time it takes to run
	'strcpy'.
	To run, type './baseline-test <number of times to run>'
	where the number of times to run is an integer.  The default
	value is 10000
	eg. './baseline-test 100000' to obtain the average time to execute
	'strcpy' 100000 times

microbench.sh:
	Performs baseline-test both with and without function interposition
	using interpose.so from the repository root
