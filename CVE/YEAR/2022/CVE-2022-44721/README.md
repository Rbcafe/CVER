# CVE-2022-44721 Crowdstrike Falcon Uninstaller
CrowdStrike Falcon is a cloud-powered endpoint detection and response (EDR) and antivirus (AV) solution. On each end-device a kernel level managed sensor is deployed and makes use of the cloud-based capabilities. The sensor can be configured with an uninstall protection. It prevents the uninstallation of CrowdStrike Falcon sensor on the end-device without a one-time generated token. 

Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker with administrative privileges to bypass the token check on Windows end-devices and to uninstall the sensor from the device without proper authorization, effectively removing the device's EDR and AV protection. 

Vulnerable sensor version: 6.44.15806 

 

## Timeline 
- 22/08/2022: After the release of CVE-2022-2841 affecting version 6.31.14505 and 6.42.15210 the Deda Cloud Cybersecurity team started ritual operation to check whether patched releases were still affected 
- 25/08/2022: CVE-2022-2841 PoC can still be used for Race Condition but does not work on version 6.44.15806. With a small change of the PoC to speed up the race condition, we were able to uninstall the fixed sensor without the security token 
- 25/08/2022: We also implemeted an easier Powershell version of the exploit 
- 25/08/2022: We sent first Powershell PoC (Falcon-6.44.15806-uninstall.ps1) to Crowdstrike support team 
- 11/11/2022: We sent exploit source code (Falcon-6.44.15806-uninstall.cpp) and proofs (PoC video) to Crowdstrike support team 
- 29/11/2022: Crowdstrike support team acknowledged the vulnerability of already hotfixed 6.44.15806 sensor and approved the release of the new CVE
