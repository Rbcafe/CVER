<!-- Brief introduction. -->
During security research, the researchers discovered that Stimulsoft Dashboards.JS is prone to multiple vulnerabilities including Stored Cross Site Scripting.

In order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker is only required to visit the Dashboards Application. This vulnerability is rated as unauthtenticated, since this product does not handle authentication on its own.
## Proof of Concept
<!-- In Depth discussion of the vulnerability. Whats it's impact, show enough proof but not too much. DO NOT INCLUDE EXPLOIT PAYLOADS! -->
A XSS payload can be injected in the field `ReportName`. When the report is loaded, the definition in the file does not get sanitized. Therefore, the payload remains persistent. This behaviour can be triggered by setting the `ReportName` to `<img src=\"#\" onerror=\"alert(1)\"/>`

After the report is loaded into the designer, the user may click on `Properties` and expand the search bar. When such behaviour occurs the XSS payload is triggered and executed.
