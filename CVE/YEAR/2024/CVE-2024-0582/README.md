# io_uring_LPE-CVE-2024-0582
LPE exploit for CVE-2024-0582.

I will not be releasing a write-up for this vulnerability as my method of exploitation is almost the same as for [CVE-2023-2598](https://github.com/ysanatomic/io_uring_LPE-CVE-2023-2598).

You can read the exploitation section of my write-up on CVE-2023-2598 to understand this exploit as well: [Conquering the memory through io_uring - Analysis of CVE-2023-2598](https://anatomic.rip/cve-2023-2598/).

If you want to read more about the vulnerability itself, Oriol Castej√≥n ([@foolisses](https://twitter.com/foolisses)) has written an excellent post on it: [Mind the Patch Gap: Exploiting an io_uring Vulnerability in Ubuntu](https://blog.exodusintel.com/2024/03/27/mind-the-patch-gap-exploiting-an-io_uring-vulnerability-in-ubuntu/)
