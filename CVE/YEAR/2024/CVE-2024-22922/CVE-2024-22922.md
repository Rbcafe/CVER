CVE-2024-22922

A Broken Authentication Vulnerability found in projectworlds' Visitor Management System

----

Because of a hardcoded login credential in the code, an attacker can log in to the web application on whether they enter the wrong credential or not.

The affected code is structured like this:

	$sql = "SELECT userName FROM login_info WHERE userName = 'shreya' AND pass= 'shreya' ";
	$match = mysqli_query($link, $sql);
	$count = mysqli_num_rows($match);`
	
	if($count == 1){
		$_SESSION["user"] = $_POST["username"];
		$_SESSION["loggedIn"] = 1;
		header("location: front.php");
	} 

 Because of this flaw, an attacker can enter an invalid credential that's not even on the database (e.g. 123:123) and still access the web application.
