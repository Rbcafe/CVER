## Proof-of-concept:

CVE-2024-21410 is a newer attack method on Microsoft Exchange focused on a vulnerability for Windows New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM), a suite of security protocols offered by Microsoft to authenticate and protect integrity. Windows uses NTLM as an older single sign-on (SSO) tool that relies on a challenge-response protocol to confirm the user without requiring them to submit a password.
