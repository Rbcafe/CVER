Note:

Originally I started maintaing gdm2 because martin didn't yet finish gdm3
and was in general busy and we needed a working gdm for 1.4.  But so much
work and new features have gone into gdm2 that perhaps the migration to
gdm3 will not happen.  Though it may be nice to integrate the good ideas
from gdm3 into this codebase and I'll be looking at that.  Do not send
gdm2 patches to martin (well you can but he'll likely ignore them:), send
them to me or Lee instead and I'll integrate them for you.
