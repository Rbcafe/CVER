  * Added xutils dependancy (closes: #76148)

    be lowered to suggests (closes: #80408)

    and doesn't decide to exit.  XDM kills the server instead of the "nice"
    method, so now we do that, too. (closes: #77163)
  * Remove non-sensical code that broke %d (closes: #75094)
  * Add documentation on the face browser (closes: #75091)
  * It seems updating the cookies already happens, so now the hostname is
    reread each time the cookies regenerate (closes: #55712)
  * Remove inappropriate Xsession session.
  * Fix a syslog() format.
