Notes of things to consider for the next major Tomcat release (10.0.x)

Items carried over from the 9.0.x list:

1.  Remove the use of system properties to control configuration wherever
    possible.

2.  Reduce instances of setters and getters for the same property existing on an
    object and its parent. This may require new objects to be exposed via JMX.

3.  Consider wrapping the SocketWrapper with a facade to detect / prevent
    components retaining references longer than they should.

New items for 10.0.x onwards:

1.  Remove APR connector.

2.  Remove org.apache.tomcat.jni and replace with the minimum necessary to
    interface with OpenSSL and clones.

3.  Remove the ExtensionValidator and associated classes (assuming that the
    minimum Java version is Java 9 or later).

4.  New embedded APIs (likely also for 9.x).
