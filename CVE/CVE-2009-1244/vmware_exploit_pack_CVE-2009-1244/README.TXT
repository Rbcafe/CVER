Beyond the Clouds aka CLOUDBURST A VMware Guest to Host Escape Exploit 
by Piotr Bania / www.piotrbania.com 

Primary readme file and exploit description is written in: 
src/VmxCloud.c 

Additionally cloud_intro.exe requires opengl drivers and c++ redists 
anyway this is available for free so google for it. If you still have 
troubles running the cloud_intro.exe (strangely though) use the utility 
in "utilz" directory to run the driver. Moreover this exploit uses some 
hardcoded address from vmware-vmx.exe (VMware Workstation 6.5.1 build 
126130) so it will not probably run with others unless you will make 
some little modifications. That's all have fun! 

P.S In intro the menu is located at the right top of the window: 
e - exploit 
a - about 
x - exit
